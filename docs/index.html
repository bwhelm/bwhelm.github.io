 also from desire-like states. This chapter identifies some criteria in terms of
 which any theory of the emotions can be assessed and reviews the central
 philosophical and psychological versions of cognitivism in light of these
 criteria. Finally, the chapter raises three interrelated problems for specifically
 cognitivist theories of emotions (the problem of circularity, the problem
 of recalcitrance, and the problem of phenomenal unity), and suggests that
 solving them requires blurring or rejecting the distinction between cognitions
 and other types of mental states, a distinction at the foundation of cognitivist
 theories of emotions.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=16tQyJ7bvdMH9qfGeZoSvm7mj2_vm2Flk" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 the role of emotions in our knowledge of social identities. A central concern
 is to understand how social identities, while being socially constructed,
 can nonetheless be objective in the sense that we can be right or wrong
 not only about what social identities a particular person has but also
 about what social identities there are and how to understand them. Social
 identities are understood as social roles defined by certain communal
 norms and values within a particular kind of community: a community of
 respect. Such norms and values in turn are constructed by complex social
 structures of emotionally grounded, conceptually informed practices within
 the community. It is argued that emotions are simultaneously experiences of
 and commitments to these norms and values, and hence that the objectivity
 of the social identities they construct is possible when participants in the
 community are able to achieve a reflective equilibrium among their emotions,
 the concepts informing these emotions, and a theory that both partially
 articulates these concepts and purports to justify the norms and practices to
 which they are committed via these emotional experiences.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--6BOQLzSc6w3TEBPvVrKuanfquHH8vP/view?usp=sharing" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 hate requires focusing on the place hate has within particular sorts of

 phenomenology of emotions? One standard way is to distinguish sharply
 between their intentionality and their phenomenology, understanding their
 phenomenology in terms of something like “bodily sensations”, which are
 simply added on to an independent account of their intentionality. I have
 elsewhere (Helm, 2011) argued that this strategy fails and that we should
 instead understand emotions to be “felt evaluations”: phenomenological
 feelings with evaluative content or, alternately, a distinctively affective form
 of intentionality. This paper repeats those arguments and extends them to
 thinking about the reactive attitudes: emotions like gratitude, resentment,
 approbation, and guilt. In particular, the phenomenology of the reactive
 attitudes cannot be neatly distinguished from the thought that their targets
 are responsible for <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">wronging </span>or <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">benefiting </span>me. In applying my earlier account
 to the reactive attitudes, I shall make apparent commonly ignored aspects
 of the affectivity of the reactive attitudes, whereby they bind us together

 a proper response to intentional (or even voluntary) and supererogatory and

 the place it has within broader interpersonal patterns of reactive attitudes, I
 argue that gratitude is better understood as itself a commitment to communal
 norms defining how we ought to manifest respect towards each other
 and as an invitation to others likewise to commit to these norms. Such
 norms thus define the social significance of that for which one is grateful,
 thereby sustaining and deepening the sort of default trust presupposed by
 communities of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QcPLpTkDUEq5C6wsm9tuhwlop2UQcvZf" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 <details style="margin-top:.5ex;"><summary><span style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:0c125d;">Abstract</span></summary><span style="font-size:.95em"><p> Tim Scanlon has recently argued that an action is <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">blameworthy </span>if it
 “show[s] something about the agent’s attitudes toward others that impairs
 the relations that others can have with him or her” and hence that “to
 <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">blame </span>a person is to judge him or her to be blameworthy and to take your
 relationship with him or her to be modified in a way that this judgment
 of impaired relations holds to be appropriate” (<span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">Moral Dimensions</span>, 128–29).
 Given this, Scanlon argues, reactive attitude accounts of blame, while they
 can capture some of the ways blaming attitudes vary depending on one’s
 relationship to the wrongdoer, are in general “too thin” and cannot explain
 all the relevant changes in our attitudes, “including changes in our readiness
 to interact with [the wrongdoer] in specific ways” (143). Yet Scanlon does
 not provide clear accounts of what types of relationships matter for blame
 and how violations of the “standards” of these relationships justifies what
 new attitudes. My aim is to address this. To do this, we need to turn not
 merely to particular reactive attitudes but to broad, interpersonal rational
 patterns of reactive attitudes in terms of which we can make sense of what
 I have come to call “communities of respect”. My claim is that the sort of
 relationship whose impairment is relevant to blame is that of co-membership
 in a community of respect, so that the significance of the agent’s wrongdoing
 relevant for blame is the significance those actions and attitudes have <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">for us </span>in
 the community. However, accommodating the variability of blame on which
 Scanlon rightly insists requires a more careful examination of two additional
 factors that affect how it is proper for one to respond to the impairment
 to those relationships that the wrongdoing represents: one’s role in a given
 case as perpetrator, victim, or witness, and one’s personal commitments.
 For, I argue, these factors provide one with excuses for failing to treat the
 perpetrator with the normal trust and respect we demand of each other, and
 the validity of these excuses itself depends on the overall rational structure of
 the patterns of reactive attitudes within the community. Consequently, both
 the individual and the community are important in defining the relationships
 and modifications of relationships that are central to blame; however, such
 modifications to personal relationships are a <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">consequence </span>of blame rather than,
 as Scanlon claims, part of its content.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhbTZkbHJwa0xlYnM" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 a remarkable series of papers, Haugeland lays out what is both a striking
 interpretation of Heidegger and a compelling account of objectivity and
 truth. Central to his account is a notion of existential commitment: a
 commitment to insist that one’s understanding of the world succeeds in
 making sense of the phenomena and so potentially to change or give up
 on that understanding in the face of apparently impossible phenomena.
 Although Haugeland never gives a clear account of existential commitment,
 he claims that it is fundamentally an individual matter. This, I argue, is a
 mistake that fails to make sense of the public, shared nature of the objective
 world. Instead, I offer an account of existential commitment as one we
 undertake <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">jointly</span>, and I analyze it (and the corresponding responsibility) in
 terms of interpersonal rational patterns of reactive attitudes: emotions like
 resentment, gratitude, indignation, approbation, guilt, and trust. The upshot
 is that our existential commitment is not only to a shared, objective world but
 also to each other such that our ability individually to <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">take </span>responsibility for
 our understanding of the world is intelligible only in terms of others’ being
 able to <span

 perceptual accounts of emotions concerns recalcitrant emotions: emotions
 that persist in the face of repudiating judgments. For, it is argued, to
 understand how the conflict between recalcitrant emotions and judgment
 falls short of incoherence in judgment, we need to understand recalcitrant
 emotions to be something like perceptual illusions of value, so that in normal,
 non-recalcitrant cases emotions are non-illusory perceptions of value. I argue
 that these arguments fail and that a closer examination of recalcitrant
 
 
 emotions reveals important disanalogies with perception that undermine the
 perceptual model of emotions.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhZDlJbjk3YnI2VGM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 commitment that is implicit in the rational structures of reactive attitudes we
 display in response to each other. In having a reactive attitude, one holds its
 target responsible to certain norms and calls on others likewise to hold her
 responsible, thereby both asserting one’s own authority and recognizing the
 authority of others to demand compliance with the norms. When this call
 is taken up by others, the interpersonal rational structure of these reactive

 investigation of particular emotions and the way such emotions might
 have social dimensions, thereby bringing into view a broader emotional
 phenomenon—in general, the phenomenon of caring—that itself can have
 social dimensions. I have long argued that caring is to be understood in terms
 of a distinctive rational pattern of emotions. In saying that caring itself can
 have a social dimension, I mean in part that the relevant pattern of rationality
 is one that extends across multiple persons, so that what it is rational for
 me to feel is tied to what it is rational for others to feel. This is the case, I
 shall argue, for the reactive emotions, which are emotions, like resentment,
 indignation, gratitude, approbation, and guilt, that we feel in response to the
 good or ill will one person shows to another. For if you resent me, I ought
 to feel guilty and others ought to feel indignation or disapprobation. Indeed,
 your resentment in effect calls on others to feel these reactive emotions, and
 (other things being equal) others’ failure to feel them is a failure properly
 to respond to you as someone worthy of our respect. By examining the
 interpersonal rational interconnections among the reactive emotions, I shall
 argue that the resulting rational patterns constitute that respect which we
 owe each other and thereby constitute this group of people as a community
 bound together by their mutual respect. This is for us to form a community
 of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcmFSM3gxUmZDa2s&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 reasons can children have for coming to care about particular things so
 that they can develop into responsible adults? This question raises issues
 both about the status of such reasons as “internal” or “external” to the
 child’s subjective motivational set and about the role of adults in guiding
 children’s choices. In confronting this latter question, Tamar Schapiro argues
 that adults can adopt what amounts to a two-pronged strategy: of rewarding
 or punishing the child and of offering explanations and justifications. Such
 a strategy, however, ignores the special role loving caregivers can play in
 a child’s life. By developing an account of such paternalistically loving
 relationships, I show how the caregiver’s conception of the child’s well-being
 can come to inform the child’s own sense of herself and so to provide her
 with essentially interpersonal reasons for caring. Indeed, such reasons can
 be both normatively and motivationally binding on the child even though
 she may not yet be in a position to understand them. That such reasons are
 essentially interpersonal seems to make otiose whether they are “internal” or
 “external,” thereby rendering that distinction less important than we might
 have thought.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFRH4f-9yzrI9Ask19ZZfMRZ7skIHF3c/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 to consider two perspectives we might take in thinking about responsibility,
 what we might call an inner and an outer perspective. The <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">inner perspective</span>
 is that of the agent herself, involving her having and exercising (or failing
 to exercise) certain agential capacities and so choosing and controlling her
 actions. The <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">outer perspective </span>is that from which we assess someone’s conduct
 and—crucially—her will as a matter of holding her to account. In each
 case, responsibility is always to a certain set of norms. From the internal
 perspective, these are norms that are <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">binding </span>on her (or to which she binds
 herself); from the outer perspective these are norms in terms of which we
 assess her and so to which we <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">hold </span>her. My aim in this paper is to argue that
 the inner perspective does not have priority over the outer perspective and
 thus that the theoretical approach is mistaken: our ability, prominent from the
 inner perspective, to take responsibility and so to hold ourselves accountable
 is not intelligible apart from our having a place in a broader community in
 which others hold us accountable. This idea, of course, is familiar to readers
 of Strawson’s “Freedom and Resentment”. However, unlike Strawson, I do
 not think this implies that the outer perspective is prior to the inner, for
 ultimately I think we cannot make sense of an agent’s being properly held
 accountable unless he can take responsibility for his actions in a way that
 ultimately presupposes his freedom. This is not something I can argue
 here; rather, my claim will be that we cannot understand an agent’s being
 accountable as depending simply on the agent herself; rather, accountable
 agency depends on capacities that are essentially social.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhRWsxaExMaXJtODQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 theories of emotions, the dominant philosophical theory as recently as
 15 years ago and still highly influential in psychology today, understand
 emotions to be essentially clusters of beliefs and desires. Thus, cognitivists
 claim, what it is to be afraid of something is to believe it dangerous and
 want to get away. The intentionality of emotions is therefore understood to
 be dependent on that of the constitutive beliefs and desires, and it seems
 that there is nothing we could call a distinctively “affective” intentionality.
 Indeed, for cognitivists affect is seemingly added on as an afterthought:
 the relevant belief and desire somehow come packaged together with a
 bodily sensation (of a sinking feeling in your gut, for example), and it is
 this packaging of those intentional states with a feeling that was supposed
 to account for their affective nature. As I shall argue, such cognitivist
 accounts of emotions fail to capture the distinctively affective character of
 emotions. A central reason for this failure lies in the kind of evaluations that
 emotions essentially involve. Cognitivist theories must understand emotional
 evaluations to be a part of either the belief or the desire; in either case,
 they are supposed to be intelligible prior to the emotions themselves. My
 
 
 contention is that this is false: we cannot make sense of these evaluations
 except in terms of the emotions themselves, and it is this fact about
 emotions that enables us to understand affective intentionality. That is, I shall
 argue, what is characteristic of affective intentionality is that it essentially
 involves evaluations that are felt, where such feelings are simultaneously
 both responsive to and constitutive of that evaluation. Our felt awareness of
 emotional objects as good or bad in some way just is a matter of our being
 emotionally pleased or pained by these objects, and this fact about emotions
 is central to understanding the nature of affective intentionality.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcXRZR0lWNFZWVjQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 to construe such identification in terms of the lover’s taking on the interests

 paradigm form of love is that between parents and infants or young children.
 I think this is mistaken: the kind of loving attitude or relationship we can
 have towards or with young children is distinct in kind from that which we
 can have towards adult persons, as is revealed by reflection on the depth of
 love and its phenomenology. My aim is to present an alternative conception
 of the sort of distinctively intimate identification at issue in love, arguing that

 nowhere does this irrationality show up more clearly than in their effects
 on motivation. Thus, to take some stereotyped examples, fear, anger, and
 jealousy frequently seem to move us to act contrary to our better judgment.
 Recently, however, there has been increasing emphasis on the rationality of
 emotions and their place in practical reason. Thus, while deliberating about
 what to do, although we may be able to articulate reasons for and against
 each option, we may not be able to say why the weight of these reasons
 favor one over the others; in such cases, we may simply go with the one
 that “feels” right—that resonates more fully with our emotional sense of
 our circumstances—and such an appeal to emotions seems appropriate. I
 argue that emotions are fundamental to motivation and practical reasoning.
 In particular, emotions motivate not because they involve mere dispositions
 to behave but rather because they are rational responses to things we care
 about, responses that sometimes rationally demand intentional action. This,
 together with the way our linguistic concepts can inform these emotional
 responses, makes for rational interconnections with evaluative judgments
 that allow our emotions to play a significant role in our determining what to
 do.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpe-9bF3TjxLqpT5yu1byXd2H_P-bGPD/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 suppose, is a feature of one’s identity as a person—of one’s sense of the
 kind of life worth living. Most attempts to explicate this notion of a person’s
 identity do so in terms of an antecedent understanding of what it is for
 a person to value something. This is, I argue, a mistake: a concern is not
 intelligible as a value apart from the place it has within a larger identity
 that the value serves in turn to constitute; to assume otherwise is to risk
 leaving out the very person whose identity these values allegedly constitute.
 By contrast, I offer an account of values as always already a part of one’s
 identity. I do so by providing an analysis of values in terms of what I call
 ’person-focused emotions,’ emotions like pride and shame. Such emotions,
 I argue, involve a commitment to the import of a person primarily and,
 only secondarily, to things valued, and in this way enable us to understand
 what it is to value these things for the sake of the person. The upshot is a
 more satisfying account of a person’s identity and values, an account that
 can provide the necessary background for a more thorough investigation of
 authenticity.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhUF95eHljajJmbWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 to engage in activity because they find it worth pursuing—because they
 care about it. In this respect, they differ from what might be called “mere
 intentional systems”: systems like chess-playing computers that exhibit
 merely goal-directed behavior mediated by instrumental rationality, without
 caring. A parallel distinction can be made in the domain of social activity:
 plural agents must be distinguished from plural intentional systems in that
 plural agents have cares and engage in activity because of those cares. In this
 paper, I sketch an account of what it is for an individual to care about things
 in terms of her exhibiting a certain pattern of emotions. After extending this
 account to make sense of an individual’s caring about other agents, I then
 
 
 show how a certain sort of emotional connectedness among a group of people
 can make intelligible the group’s having cares and thereby constitute that
 group as a plural agent. Alternative accounts of social action, by ignoring
 the difference between mere intentional systems and genuine agents, and so
 by leaving out these emotional entanglements from their accounts of social
 action, thereby fail to capture a whole range of social phenomena involving
 plural agents.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhdnA3MU1UeVdKTWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 and pains are not qualia and they are not to be analyzed in terms of
 supposedly antecedently intelligible mental states like bodily sensation or
 desire. Rather, pleasure and pain are characteristic of a distinctive kind
 of evaluation that is common to emotions, desires, and (some) bodily
 sensations. These are felt evaluations: passive responses to attend to and
 be motivated by the import of something impressing itself on us, responses
 that are nonetheless simultaneously constitutive of that import by virtue of
 the broader rational patterns of which they are a part and that they serve
 to de?ne. This account of felt evaluations makes sense of the way in which
 pleasures and pains grab our attention and motivate us to act and of the
 peculiar dual objectivity and subjectivity of their implicit evaluations, while
 o?ering a phenomenology adequate to both emotional and bodily pleasures
 and pains.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhRDhCa1AyUUpmUTA&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 understanding how we can have rational control over what we do. In
 
 
 the face of phenomena like weakness of the will, it is commonly thought
 that evaluation and reason can always remain intact even as we sever
 their connection with motivation; consequently, solving the motivational
 problem is thought to be a matter of figuring out how to bridge this
 inevitable gap between evaluation and motivation. I argue that this is
 fundamentally mistaken and results in a conception of practical reason
 that is motivationally impotent. Instead, I argue, a proper understanding of
 evaluation and practical reason must include not only evaluative judgments
 but emotions as well. By analyzing the role of emotions in evaluation
 and the rational interconnections among emotions, desires, and evaluative
 judgments, I articulate a new conception of evaluation and motivation
 according to which there is a conceptual connection between them, albeit one
 that allows for the possibility of weakness of the will.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhV0lvU2o1blhiY2c&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 personal, non-moral values involves elements of both invention and
 discovery. Thus, we invent our values by freely choosing them, where
 such distinctively human freedom is essential to our defining and taking
 responsibility for the kinds of persons we are; nonetheless, we also discover
 our values insofar as we can deliberate about them rationally and arrive
 at non-arbitrary decisions about what has value in our lives. Yet these
 notions of invention and discovery seem inconsistent with each other, and
 the possibility of deliberation about value therefore seems paradoxical. My
 aim is to argue that this apparent paradox is no paradox at all. I offer
 an account of what it is to value something largely in terms of emotions
 and desires. By examining the rational interconnections among emotions
 and evaluative judgments, I argue for an account both of how judgments
 can shape our emotions, thereby shaping our values in a way that makes
 intelligible the possibility of inventing our values, and of how our emotions
 can simultaneously rationally constrain correct deliberation, thereby making
 intelligible the possibility of discovering our values. The result is a rejection
 of both cognitivist and non-cognitivist accounts of value and deliberation
 about value.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhM1lwNVprU0toRmM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 interrelated elements of Hume’s account of causation have received so little
 attention in the secondary literature on the subject. The first is the distinction
 of causation into the natural and the philosophical relations: Although
 many have tried to give accounts of why Hume presents two definitions of
 causality, it is often not clear in these accounts that the one definition is of
 causality as a natural relation and the other is of causality as a philosophical
 relation, where to make the contrast between these two kinds of relations
 we need to give a naturalistic account of natural relations and a normative
 account of philosophical relations. (That Hume intends this to be the contrast
 will be defended in more detail below.) The second element is that, in many
 cases of our inferences from cause to effect, “we must follow our taste and
 sentiment” (A Treatise of Human Nature [T], 103), where the appeal to taste
 here, as in morality and aesthetics, is not to be understood as up to the
 individual. Rather, Hume makes it clear both in Book 3 of the Treatise and in
 “Of the Standard of Taste” that there are standards to which our individual
 judgments (in morality, aesthetics, or causality) must conform. My purpose
 in this paper is to attempt to provide an interpretation of Hume’s account of
 causality that brings these two elements explicitly into the foreground. This
 interpretation is, to a greater extent than usual, a reconstruction of Hume’s
 account of our causal inferences, drawing, as I have indicated above, from a
 range of texts not normally associated with Hume’s discussion of causality.
 As such, this interpretation should be considered as exploratory in nature,
 perhaps focussing too single-mindedly on these two elements in an attempt
 to make out as strong a case as possible for their relevance in understanding
 Hume’s account of causal inference.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0bmKWBSS4XPGUaNENHaf9il3jVI09Og/view?usp=sharing" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p></li></ol>
