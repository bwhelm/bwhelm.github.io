 id="x1-50002"></a>Research</h3>
<!--l. 190--><p class="indent" > The central aim of my research has been to understand more deeply the kind of
rationality characteristic of us persons, and I have argued both (a) that such rationality,
rather than being opposed to the emotions, instead is an essentially emotional
rationality (what I call a “rationality of import”) and (b) that such rationality is not
intelligible apart from our social relations with others. Consequently, I believe it is a
mistake to conceive of us persons as divided into distinct theoretical and practical
sides or to approach understanding personhood via distinct metaphysical and moral
notions. The rationality of import, as I have understood it, is simultaneously both
practical and theoretical: our being the sort of epistemic agents we are rests on our
practical capacities collectively to value (and to hold each other responsible to) public,
objective truth, and our being the sort of moral agents we are depends on our
epistemic abilities to contest and so ultimately to discover what has objective
value. Moreover, the “metaphysical” capacities we have for autonomous,
rational, and responsible agency are capacities we ourselves construct via the
interpersonal commitments to import we collectively undertake. The result is that
through our practical agency, we jointly construct ourselves as persons in
a way that is simultaneously answerable to our experience of personhood
itself.
<!--l. 192--><p class="indent" > I reach this conclusion over the course of three books in which I find moral
psychology and value theory deeply intertwined with philosophy of mind and
emotions and with social ontology. My work is highly systematic, with these books
taking me from a consideration of (1) intrapersonal values and identity, to (2)
 
 
interpersonal values in intimate relationships, to (3) communal norms and values in
the context of non-intimate “communities of respect”, all of which lead to my current
research to the objectivity of social identities.

<!--l. 196--><p class="indent" > One characteristic of us persons is that we value things as a part of the kind of life
we each find worth living, thereby partially constituting our identities as the particular
persons we are, such that part of our autonomy consists in our ability to determine
what our values shall be. On the other hand, we persons can also rationally
deliberate about what really is valuable in our lives, thereby potentially coming to
discover who we are. Yet such autonomous invention and rational discovery of
personal values might seem to be in tension with one another (how can personal
values be something we simultaneously both invent and discover?), and this
book aims to resolve that tension by developing an account of the relation
between emotions and value (or of “<em>import</em>” more generally) that enables me to
reject the rational and ontological priority implicit in this formulation of the
tension.
<!--l. 198--><p class="indent" > In developing this account, I focus not on particular kinds of emotions but rather
on the sorts of <em>rational patterns</em> emotions can form, arguing that such patterns
constitute what it is for things to have import to one. The kind of rationality involved
in these patterns of emotions is what I call a “<em>rationality of import</em>”, and it does not fit
neatly into standard ways of thinking about practical or theoretical rationality. If
we accept (as I do) the Davidsonian thesis that mental capacities are to be
understood in terms of rationality, such a rethinking of rationality means
reconceiving the nature of the mind quite generally and of believing and desiring
in particular. This enables me to make sense of the distinctive rational role
emotions play both in relation to desire and evaluative judgment, thereby
dissolving the above tension, and in relation to motivation, thereby making
intelligible how we can have rational control over what we do and yet be
susceptible to even strong forms of weakness of will. Indeed, I argue that this is
essential to presenting an account of the mind adequate to a serious moral
psychology.

<!--l. 202--><p class="indent" > We persons are social animals, partly insofar as we are able to form intimate
relationships with others and thereby can come to share our lives, our identities, and
our capacity for autonomy with others in relationships of love and friendship. In
this book, I argue against various forms of individualism and egocentrism I
find implicit in many other accounts of love and friendship, and I present an
alternative account of love as intimate identification in terms of <em>interpersonal</em>
rational patterns of emotions. On the one hand this enables me to explain how a
caregiver in a loving relationship with a child can provide the child with access
to reasons (for being neat or for being moral) that otherwise might seem
“external” to the child’s existing motivations. On the other hand, this account of
love enables me to present a rich account of shared agency and ultimately
of friendship in terms of the notions of <em>plural agents</em> (who not only share
certain ends but also the cares motivating those ends) and <em>plural persons</em> (who
share values and hence a conception of the kind of life worth their living
together) and to show how they can, partly through their rationally intertwined
emotions, deliberate together and exercise joint autonomy over their shared
lives.

<!--l. 206--><p class="indent" > To make sense of persons, we must consider as well the <em>non-intimate</em> relationships
we have with others who are in community with us. In this book I join other
Strawsonians in thinking that the reactive attitudes and the ways we <em>hold</em> each other
responsible is central to our being responsible agents at all. Yet in contrast to other
accounts, I reject the explanatory <em>priority</em> of the reactive attitudes over our being
responsible agents: our reactive attitudes are appropriate in part because
they are directed at responsible agents, while simultaneously someone is
a responsible agent because they are an appropriate target of the reactive
attitudes. I make sense of such circularity as non-vicious by appealing to
interpersonal, rational patterns of reactive attitudes, which I argue constitute the
community itself, communal norms and values as <em>our</em> norms and values, and
so individual members of the community as bound by those norms and as
having the authority to hold each other responsible to them. Consequently, we
in the community <em>collectively</em> respect each other as members, and each as
one of us ought therefore to respect the others as members. Such an account
is not second-personal but <em>first-person plural</em>, a conclusion that has several
important implications for the social dimension of us persons. First, <em>responsibility is
social</em>: to be a responsible agent requires that one have the capacity for reactive
 
 
attitudes, a capacity that one can develop and sustain only as a member of a
community of respect. Second, <em>rationality is social</em>: insofar as it is we collectively
who have authority over ourselves, we must reject a Humean conception of
practical reason (as depending on one’s “subjective motivation set”, say) and
recognize an essentially social dimension to practical reason and the possible
connections and conflicts among such social reasons and individual reasons
grounded in, for example, personal values. Finally, <em>identity is social</em>: a community
of respect can shape and define certain social identities by prescribing or
proscribing communal values as elements of the kind of life worth its members
living.

<!--l. 210--><p class="indent" > In the last few years I have begun to apply these ideas to the topic of social
construction, especially of social roles and identities. Social roles and identities
presuppose an at least rough-and-ready understanding of them in virtue of
which the various communal norms and values that partly define them hang
together as a coherent whole that can have a point in our lives. Indeed, these
understandings must normally come to inform the patterns of participants’
reactive attitudes constituting those norms and values and hence the role
itself. This makes room for the possibility that participants’ experiences of
themselves as occupants of these roles is inconsistent with the background
understandings and point, providing empirical purchase for rationally contesting
those understandings and hence the norms and roles themselves. Whereas others
think about such contestation as grounded in unjust <em>consequences</em> of these social
roles, my claim is that they can also be grounded in the roles themselves
being <em>ontologically misconstructed</em>. That is, our construction of social roles and
identities can be objective in that our activities of construction can come to be
answerable to the very roles and identities they thereby construct in a way that
opens up the possibility of our getting these roles and identities themselves
wrong.
<!--l. 215--><p class="indent" > Ultimately my aim is to provide an account of moral values as the communal
values of the community of respect of all persons, a community in which
these values and our personhood itself are both socially constructed and
contestable.

 are communities of people sharing common practices or a (partial) way
 of life; they include families, clubs, religious groups, and political parties.
 This book develops a detailed account of such communities in terms of
 the rational structure of their members’ reactive attitudes, arguing that they
 are fundamental in three interrelated ways to understanding what it is
 to be a person. First, it is only by being a member of a community of
 respect that one can be a responsible agent having dignity; such an agent
 therefore has certain rights as well as the authority to demand that fellow
 members recognize her dignity and follow the norms of the community,
 norms compliance with which they likewise have the authority to demand
 from her. Second, by prescribing or proscribing both actions and values,
 communities of respect can shape the identities of its members in ways
 that others have the authority to enforce, thereby revealing an important
 interpersonal dimension of the identities of persons. Finally, all of this is
 grounded in a distinctively interpersonal form of practical rationality in
 virtue of which we jointly have reasons to recognize the dignity and authority
 of fellow members and so to comply with their authoritative demands, as
 well as to respect (and so comply with) the norms of the community. Hence
 we persons are essentially social creatures.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhR2ZtZ2pqQmZHZ2c" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 consistently emphasized the individualistic strand in our understanding of
 persons at the expense of the social strand. Thus, it is generally thought that
 persons are self-determining and autonomous, where these are understood
 to be capacities we exercise most fully on our own, apart from others, whose
 
 
 influence on us tends to undermine that autonomy. <em>Love, Friendship, and
 the Self</em> argues that we must reject a strongly individualistic conception of
 persons if we are to make sense of significant interpersonal relationships
 and the importance they can have in our lives. It presents a new account
 of love as intimate identification and of friendship as a kind of plural
 agency, in each case grounding and analyzing these notions in terms of
 interpersonal emotions. At the center of this account is an analysis of how
 our emotional connectedness with others is essential to our very capacities
 for autonomy and self-determination: we are rational and autonomous only
 because of and through our inherently social nature. By focusing on the role
 that relationships of love and friendship have both in the initial formation
 of our selves and in the on-going development and maturation of adult
 persons, Helm significantly alters our understanding of persons and the kind
 of psychology we persons have as moral and social beings.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhOTEteU5GeEthckU&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 identities are socially constructed, the community may nonetheless get
 them wrong, misconstructing and thereby distorting them. Particularly in
 identity categories where there is prevalent injustice built into the system,
 the likelihood is high that there is a better alternative understanding of the
 identities out there relative to the one in the dominant community. In such
 cases, one may get angry at others for distorting or erasing one’s identity,
 and while anger may often build a wall of separation between people, it can
 in other cases be a powerful tool for helping others recognize and overcome
 this distortion. We try to characterize such anger and show how it can build
 bridges across individuals and communities so as to change our collective
 understandings of our identities. The result is a more nuanced account of

 This chapter aims to understand the role of emotions in our knowledge of
 social identities. A central concern is to understand how social identities,
 while being socially constructed, can nonetheless be objective in the sense
 that we can be right or wrong not only about what social identities a
 particular person has but also about what social identities there are and
 how to understand them. Social identities are understood as social roles
 defined by certain communal norms and values within a particular kind
 of community: a community of respect. Such norms and values in turn
 are constructed by complex social structures of emotionally grounded,
 conceptually informed practices within the community. It is argued that
 emotions are simultaneously experiences of and commitments to these
 norms and values, and hence that the objectivity of the social identities they
 construct is possible when participants in the community are able to achieve
 a reflective equilibrium among their emotions, the concepts informing these
 emotions, and a theory that both partially articulates these concepts and
 purports to justify the norms and practices to which they are committed via
 these emotional experiences.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--6BOQLzSc6w3TEBPvVrKuanfquHH8vP/view?usp=sharing" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 Harry Frankfurt argues that the paradigm form of love is that between
 parents and infants or young children. I think this is mistaken: the kind of
 loving attitude or relationship we can have towards or with young children
 is distinct in kind from that which we can have towards adult persons, as is
 revealed by reflection on the depth of love and its phenomenology. My aim
 is to present an alternative conception of the sort of distinctively intimate
 identification at issue in love, arguing that this account makes better sense of
 love and our experience of love.</span></details>

 an account of emotions like pride and shame as “person-focused” and so
 analyzing their rational interconnections, I offer a non-egocentric account of
 intimacy as a kind of identification: an identification which, when reflexive,
 constitutes one’s own identity and, when non-reflexive, constitutes the close,
 personal attachment to another that love is.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhWnpvSzZwSlJJOG8&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 of one’s identity as a person—of one’s sense of the kind of life worth living.
 Most attempts to explicate this notion of a person’s identity do so in terms of
 an antecedent understanding of what it is for a person to value something.
 This is, I argue, a mistake: a concern is not intelligible as a value apart from
 the place it has within a larger identity that the value serves in turn to
 constitute; to assume otherwise is to risk leaving out the very person whose
 identity these values allegedly constitute. By contrast, I offer an account of
 values as always already a part of one’s identity. I do so by providing an
 analysis of values in terms of what I call ’person-focused emotions,’ emotions
 like pride and shame. Such emotions, I argue, involve a commitment to the
 import of a person primarily and, only secondarily, to things valued, and in
 this way enable us to understand what it is to value these things for the sake
 of the person. The upshot is a more satisfying account of a person’s identity
 and values, an account that can provide the necessary background for a more
 thorough investigation of authenticity.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhUF95eHljajJmbWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p></li></ol>

 This chapter aims to understand the role of emotions in our knowledge of
 social identities. A central concern is to understand how social identities,
 while being socially constructed, can nonetheless be objective in the sense
 that we can be right or wrong not only about what social identities a
 particular person has but also about what social identities there are and
 how to understand them. Social identities are understood as social roles
 defined by certain communal norms and values within a particular kind
 of community: a community of respect. Such norms and values in turn
 are constructed by complex social structures of emotionally grounded,
 conceptually informed practices within the community. It is argued that
 emotions are simultaneously experiences of and commitments to these
 norms and values, and hence that the objectivity of the social identities they
 construct is possible when participants in the community are able to achieve
 a reflective equilibrium among their emotions, the concepts informing these
 emotions, and a theory that both partially articulates these concepts and
 
 
 purports to justify the norms and practices to which they are committed via
 these emotional experiences.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--6BOQLzSc6w3TEBPvVrKuanfquHH8vP/view?usp=sharing" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 Haugeland lays out what is both a striking interpretation of Heidegger
 and a compelling account of objectivity and truth. Central to his account
 is a notion of existential commitment: a commitment to insist that one’s
 understanding of the world succeeds in making sense of the phenomena
 and so potentially to change or give up on that understanding in the face
 of apparently impossible phenomena. Although Haugeland never gives a
 clear account of existential commitment, he claims that it is fundamentally
 an individual matter. This, I argue, is a mistake that fails to make sense
 of the public, shared nature of the objective world. Instead, I offer an
 account of existential commitment as one we undertake <em>jointly</em>, and I
 analyze it (and the corresponding responsibility) in terms of interpersonal
 rational patterns of reactive attitudes: emotions like resentment, gratitude,
 indignation, approbation, guilt, and trust. The upshot is that our existential
 commitment is not only to a shared, objective world but also to each other
 such that our ability individually to <em>take</em> responsibility for our understanding
 of the world is intelligible only in terms of others’ being able to <em>hold</em> us
 responsible for it.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhU3FJYThiMFpsQkU&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 argument in favor of perceptual accounts of emotions concerns recalcitrant
 emotions: emotions that persist in the face of repudiating judgments. For,
 it is argued, to understand how the conflict between recalcitrant emotions
 and judgment falls short of incoherence in judgment, we need to understand
 recalcitrant emotions to be something like perceptual illusions of value, so
 that in normal, non-recalcitrant cases emotions are non-illusory perceptions
 of value. I argue that these arguments fail and that a closer examination
 of recalcitrant emotions reveals important disanalogies with perception that

 have for coming to care about particular things so that they can develop into
 responsible adults? This question raises issues both about the status of such
 reasons as “internal” or “external” to the child’s subjective motivational set
 
 
 and about the role of adults in guiding children’s choices. In confronting this
 latter question, Tamar Schapiro argues that adults can adopt what amounts to
 a two-pronged strategy: of rewarding or punishing the child and of offering
 explanations and justifications. Such a strategy, however, ignores the special
 role loving caregivers can play in a child’s life. By developing an account
 of such paternalistically loving relationships, I show how the caregiver’s
 conception of the child’s well-being can come to inform the child’s own sense
 of herself and so to provide her with essentially interpersonal reasons for
 caring. Indeed, such reasons can be both normatively and motivationally
 binding on the child even though she may not yet be in a position to
 understand them. That such reasons are essentially interpersonal seems to
 make otiose whether they are “internal” or “external,” thereby rendering that
 distinction less important than we might have thought.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFRH4f-9yzrI9Ask19ZZfMRZ7skIHF3c/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 able to engage in activity because they find it worth pursuing—because they
 care about it. In this respect, they differ from what might be called “mere
 intentional systems”: systems like chess-playing computers that exhibit
 merely goal-directed behavior mediated by instrumental rationality, without
 caring. A parallel distinction can be made in the domain of social activity:
 plural agents must be distinguished from plural intentional systems in that
 plural agents have cares and engage in activity because of those cares. In this
 paper, I sketch an account of what it is for an individual to care about things
 in terms of her exhibiting a certain pattern of emotions. After extending this
 account to make sense of an individual’s caring about other agents, I then
 show how a certain sort of emotional connectedness among a group of people
 can make intelligible the group’s having cares and thereby constitute that
 group as a plural agent. Alternative accounts of social action, by ignoring
 the difference between mere intentional systems and genuine agents, and so
 by leaving out these emotional entanglements from their accounts of social
 action, thereby fail to capture a whole range of social phenomena involving
 plural agents.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhdnA3MU1UeVdKTWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 personal, non-moral values involves elements of both invention and

 such distinctively human freedom is essential to our defining and taking

 our values insofar as we can deliberate about them rationally and arrive
 at non-arbitrary decisions about what has value in our lives. Yet these
 notions of invention and discovery seem inconsistent with each other, and
 the possibility of deliberation about value therefore seems paradoxical. My

 an account of what it is to value something largely in terms of emotions
 and desires. By examining the rational interconnections among emotions
 and evaluative judgments, I argue for an account both of how judgments
 can shape our emotions, thereby shaping our values in a way that makes
 intelligible the possibility of inventing our values, and of how our emotions
 can simultaneously rationally constrain correct deliberation, thereby making
 intelligible the possibility of discovering our values. The result is a rejection

 in this paper is to step back from an investigation of particular emotions
 and the way such emotions might have social dimensions, thereby bringing
 into view a broader emotional phenomenon—in general, the phenomenon of
 
 
 caring—that itself can have social dimensions. I have long argued that caring
 is to be understood in terms of a distinctive rational pattern of emotions.
 In saying that caring itself can have a social dimension, I mean in part
 that the relevant pattern of rationality is one that extends across multiple
 persons, so that what it is rational for me to feel is tied to what it is rational
 for others to feel. This is the case, I shall argue, for the reactive emotions,
 which are emotions, like resentment, indignation, gratitude, approbation,
 and guilt, that we feel in response to the good or ill will one person shows
 to another. For if you resent me, I ought to feel guilty and others ought to
 feel indignation or disapprobation. Indeed, your resentment in effect calls on
 others to feel these reactive emotions, and (other things being equal) others’
 failure to feel them is a failure properly to respond to you as someone worthy
 of our respect. By examining the interpersonal rational interconnections
 among the reactive emotions, I shall argue that the resulting rational patterns
 constitute that respect which we owe each other and thereby constitute this
 group of people as a community bound together by their mutual respect.
 This is for us to form a community of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcmFSM3gxUmZDa2s&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 able to engage in activity because they find it worth pursuing—because they
 care about it. In this respect, they differ from what might be called “mere
 intentional systems”: systems like chess-playing computers that exhibit
 merely goal-directed behavior mediated by instrumental rationality, without
 caring. A parallel distinction can be made in the domain of social activity:
 plural agents must be distinguished from plural intentional systems in that
 plural agents have cares and engage in activity because of those cares. In this
 paper, I sketch an account of what it is for an individual to care about things
 in terms of her exhibiting a certain pattern of emotions. After extending this
 
 
 account to make sense of an individual’s caring about other agents, I then
 show how a certain sort of emotional connectedness among a group of people
 can make intelligible the group’s having cares and thereby constitute that
 group as a plural agent. Alternative accounts of social action, by ignoring
 the difference between mere intentional systems and genuine agents, and so
 by leaving out these emotional entanglements from their accounts of social
 action, thereby fail to capture a whole range of social phenomena involving
 plural agents.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhdnA3MU1UeVdKTWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p></li></ol>

 differs from mere disliking in terms of its “depth”, which is understood via a
 notion of “<em>othering</em>”, whereby one rejects at least some aspect of the identity
 of the target of hate, identifying oneself as not being what they are. Fleshing
 this out reveals important differences between <em>personal hate</em>, which targets
 a particular individual, and <em>impersonal hate</em>, which targets <em>groups</em> of people.
 Moreover, impersonal hate requires focusing on the place hate has within
 particular sorts of communities, enabling a further important distinction
 between “insider” and “outsider” hate in terms of whether the hater includes
 members of the targeted group within a particular community or rejects them
 as “beneath” membership in that community.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/176o0Q-Gt2yW9R8kSf9e0Vih6ZtznbLfK/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 mistake that ignores the social significance not only of the benefactor’s
 actions but also of gratitude itself. By focusing on the place it has within
 broader interpersonal patterns of reactive attitudes, I argue that gratitude
 
 
 is better understood as itself a commitment to communal norms defining
 how we ought to manifest respect towards each other and as an invitation
 to others likewise to commit to these norms. Such norms thus define the
 social significance of that for which one is grateful, thereby sustaining and
 deepening the sort of default trust presupposed by communities of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QcPLpTkDUEq5C6wsm9tuhwlop2UQcvZf" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 argued that an action is <em>blameworthy</em> if it “show[s] something about the
 agent’s attitudes toward others that impairs the relations that others can
 have with him or her” and hence that “to <em>blame</em> a person is to judge him
 or her to be blameworthy and to take your relationship with him or her
 to be modified in a way that this judgment of impaired relations holds
 to be appropriate” (<em>Moral Dimensions</em>, 128–29). Given this, Scanlon argues,
 reactive attitude accounts of blame, while they can capture some of the ways
 blaming attitudes vary depending on one’s relationship to the wrongdoer,
 are in general “too thin” and cannot explain all the relevant changes in
 our attitudes, “including changes in our readiness to interact with [the
 wrongdoer] in specific ways” (143). Yet Scanlon does not provide clear
 accounts of what types of relationships matter for blame and how violations
 of the “standards” of these relationships justifies what new attitudes. My
 aim is to address this. To do this, we need to turn not merely to particular
 reactive attitudes but to broad, interpersonal rational patterns of reactive
 attitudes in terms of which we can make sense of what I have come to call
 “communities of respect”. My claim is that the sort of relationship whose
 impairment is relevant to blame is that of co-membership in a community
 of respect, so that the significance of the agent’s wrongdoing relevant for
 blame is the significance those actions and attitudes have <em>for us</em> in the
 community. However, accommodating the variability of blame on which
 Scanlon rightly insists requires a more careful examination of two additional
 factors that affect how it is proper for one to respond to the impairment
 to those relationships that the wrongdoing represents: one’s role in a given
 case as perpetrator, victim, or witness, and one’s personal commitments.
 For, I argue, these factors provide one with excuses for failing to treat the
 perpetrator with the normal trust and respect we demand of each other, and
 the validity of these excuses itself depends on the overall rational structure of
 the patterns of reactive attitudes within the community. Consequently, both
 the individual and the community are important in defining the relationships
 and modifications of relationships that are central to blame; however, such
 modifications to personal relationships are a <em>consequence</em> of blame rather than,
 as Scanlon claims, part of its content.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhbTZkbHJwa0xlYnM" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 gratitude, resentment, approbation, and guilt. For in expressing the reactive
 attitudes we call others to account in light of shared norms, thereby not
 merely communicating a positive or negative evaluation of the other’s actions
 but also expressing the underlying values as <em>our</em> values in a way that can
 preserve and reinforce this shared sense of value.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="http://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhci1VVUYzQ2JHT3M" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 that is implicit in the rational structures of reactive attitudes we display
 in response to each other. In having a reactive attitude, one holds its
 target responsible to certain norms and calls on others likewise to hold her
 responsible, thereby both asserting one’s own authority and recognizing the
 authority of others to demand compliance with the norms. When this call
 is taken up by others, the interpersonal rational structure of these reactive

 have for coming to care about particular things so that they can develop into
 responsible adults? This question raises issues both about the status of such
 reasons as “internal” or “external” to the child’s subjective motivational set
 and about the role of adults in guiding children’s choices. In confronting this
 latter question, Tamar Schapiro argues that adults can adopt what amounts to
 a two-pronged strategy: of rewarding or punishing the child and of offering
 explanations and justifications. Such a strategy, however, ignores the special
 role loving caregivers can play in a child’s life. By developing an account
 of such paternalistically loving relationships, I show how the caregiver’s
 conception of the child’s well-being can come to inform the child’s own sense
 of herself and so to provide her with essentially interpersonal reasons for
 caring. Indeed, such reasons can be both normatively and motivationally
 binding on the child even though she may not yet be in a position to
 understand them. That such reasons are essentially interpersonal seems to
 make otiose whether they are “internal” or “external,” thereby rendering that
 distinction less important than we might have thought.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFRH4f-9yzrI9Ask19ZZfMRZ7skIHF3c/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 is responsible agency? I want to consider two perspectives we might take
 in thinking about responsibility, what we might call an inner and an outer
 perspective. The <em>inner perspective</em> is that of the agent herself, involving her
 having and exercising (or failing to exercise) certain agential capacities and so
 choosing and controlling her actions. The <em>outer perspective</em> is that from which
 we assess someone’s conduct and—crucially—her will as a matter of holding
 her to account. In each case, responsibility is always to a certain set of norms.
 From the internal perspective, these are norms that are <em>binding</em> on her (or to
 which she binds herself); from the outer perspective these are norms in terms
 of which we assess her and so to which we <em>hold</em> her. My aim in this paper
 is to argue that the inner perspective does not have priority over the outer
 perspective and thus that the theoretical approach is mistaken: our ability,
 prominent from the inner perspective, to take responsibility and so to hold
 ourselves accountable is not intelligible apart from our having a place in a
 broader community in which others hold us accountable. This idea, of course,
 is familiar to readers of Strawson’s “Freedom and Resentment”. However,
 unlike Strawson, I do not think this implies that the outer perspective is prior
 to the inner, for ultimately I think we cannot make sense of an agent’s being
 properly held accountable unless he can take responsibility for his actions
 in a way that ultimately presupposes his freedom. This is not something
 
 
 I can argue here; rather, my claim will be that we cannot understand an
 agent’s being accountable as depending simply on the agent herself; rather,
 accountable agency depends on capacities that are essentially social.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhRWsxaExMaXJtODQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 we can best understand the reactive attitudes by seeing them as individually
 presupposing and jointly constituting both our respect for persons and the
 dignity to which that respect is responsive. Consequently, being both a
 proper subject and object of the reactive attitudes is to be a member of
 the normative community of fellow persons within which one both takes

 Harry Frankfurt argues that the paradigm form of love is that between

 of one’s identity as a person—of one’s sense of the kind of life worth living.
 Most attempts to explicate this notion of a person’s identity do so in terms of
 an antecedent understanding of what it is for a person to value something.
 This is, I argue, a mistake: a concern is not intelligible as a value apart from
 the place it has within a larger identity that the value serves in turn to
 constitute; to assume otherwise is to risk leaving out the very person whose
 identity these values allegedly constitute. By contrast, I offer an account of
 values as always already a part of one’s identity. I do so by providing an
 analysis of values in terms of what I call ’person-focused emotions,’ emotions
 like pride and shame. Such emotions, I argue, involve a commitment to the
 import of a person primarily and, only secondarily, to things valued, and in
 this way enable us to understand what it is to value these things for the sake
 of the person. The upshot is a more satisfying account of a person’s identity
 and values, an account that can provide the necessary background for a more
 thorough investigation of authenticity.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhUF95eHljajJmbWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 problem of understanding how we can have rational control over what we
 do. In the face of phenomena like weakness of the will, it is commonly
 thought that evaluation and reason can always remain intact even as we sever
 their connection with motivation; consequently, solving the motivational
 problem is thought to be a matter of figuring out how to bridge this
 inevitable gap between evaluation and motivation. I argue that this is
 fundamentally mistaken and results in a conception of practical reason
 that is motivationally impotent. Instead, I argue, a proper understanding of
 evaluation and practical reason must include not only evaluative judgments
 but emotions as well. By analyzing the role of emotions in evaluation
 and the rational interconnections among emotions, desires, and evaluative
 judgments, I articulate a new conception of evaluation and motivation
 
 
 according to which there is a conceptual connection between them, albeit one
 that allows for the possibility of weakness of the will.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhV0lvU2o1blhiY2c&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 personal, non-moral values involves elements of both invention and
 discovery. Thus, we invent our values by freely choosing them, where
 such distinctively human freedom is essential to our defining and taking
 responsibility for the kinds of persons we are; nonetheless, we also discover
 our values insofar as we can deliberate about them rationally and arrive
 at non-arbitrary decisions about what has value in our lives. Yet these
 notions of invention and discovery seem inconsistent with each other, and
 the possibility of deliberation about value therefore seems paradoxical. My
 aim is to argue that this apparent paradox is no paradox at all. I offer
 an account of what it is to value something largely in terms of emotions
 and desires. By examining the rational interconnections among emotions
 and evaluative judgments, I argue for an account both of how judgments
 can shape our emotions, thereby shaping our values in a way that makes
 intelligible the possibility of inventing our values, and of how our emotions
 can simultaneously rationally constrain correct deliberation, thereby making
 intelligible the possibility of discovering our values. The result is a rejection
 of both cognitivist and non-cognitivist accounts of value and deliberation
 about value.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhM1lwNVprU0toRmM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 One central argument in favor of perceptual accounts of emotions concerns
 recalcitrant emotions: emotions that persist in the face of repudiating
 judgments. For, it is argued, to understand how the conflict between
 recalcitrant emotions and judgment falls short of incoherence in judgment,
 we need to understand recalcitrant emotions to be something like perceptual
 illusions of value, so that in normal, non-recalcitrant cases emotions are
 non-illusory perceptions of value. I argue that these arguments fail and that
 a closer examination of recalcitrant emotions reveals important disanalogies
 with perception that undermine the perceptual model of emotions.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhZDlJbjk3YnI2VGM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 is responsible agency? I want to consider two perspectives we might take
 in thinking about responsibility, what we might call an inner and an outer
 perspective. The <em>inner perspective</em> is that of the agent herself, involving her
 having and exercising (or failing to exercise) certain agential capacities and so
 choosing and controlling her actions. The <em>outer perspective</em> is that from which
 we assess someone’s conduct and—crucially—her will as a matter of holding
 her to account. In each case, responsibility is always to a certain set of norms.
 From the internal perspective, these are norms that are <em>binding</em> on her (or to
 which she binds herself); from the outer perspective these are norms in terms
 of which we assess her and so to which we <em>hold</em> her. My aim in this paper
 is to argue that the inner perspective does not have priority over the outer
 perspective and thus that the theoretical approach is mistaken: our ability,
 prominent from the inner perspective, to take responsibility and so to hold
 ourselves accountable is not intelligible apart from our having a place in a
 broader community in which others hold us accountable. This idea, of course,
 is familiar to readers of Strawson’s “Freedom and Resentment”. However,
 unlike Strawson, I do not think this implies that the outer perspective is prior
 to the inner, for ultimately I think we cannot make sense of an agent’s being
 properly held accountable unless he can take responsibility for his actions
 in a way that ultimately presupposes his freedom. This is not something
 I can argue here; rather, my claim will be that we cannot understand an
 agent’s being accountable as depending simply on the agent herself; rather,
 accountable agency depends on capacities that are essentially social.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhRWsxaExMaXJtODQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 able to engage in activity because they find it worth pursuing—because they
 care about it. In this respect, they differ from what might be called “mere
 intentional systems”: systems like chess-playing computers that exhibit
 merely goal-directed behavior mediated by instrumental rationality, without
 caring. A parallel distinction can be made in the domain of social activity:
 plural agents must be distinguished from plural intentional systems in that
 plural agents have cares and engage in activity because of those cares. In this
 paper, I sketch an account of what it is for an individual to care about things
 in terms of her exhibiting a certain pattern of emotions. After extending this
 account to make sense of an individual’s caring about other agents, I then
 show how a certain sort of emotional connectedness among a group of people
 can make intelligible the group’s having cares and thereby constitute that
 group as a plural agent. Alternative accounts of social action, by ignoring
 the difference between mere intentional systems and genuine agents, and so
 by leaving out these emotional entanglements from their accounts of social
 action, thereby fail to capture a whole range of social phenomena involving
 plural agents.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhdnA3MU1UeVdKTWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 How should we understand the phenomenology of emotions? One standard
 way is to distinguish sharply between their intentionality and their
 phenomenology, understanding their phenomenology in terms of something
 like “bodily sensations”, which are simply added on to an independent
 account of their intentionality. I have elsewhere (Helm, 2011) argued that
 this strategy fails and that we should instead understand emotions to be
 “felt evaluations”: phenomenological feelings with evaluative content or,
 alternately, a distinctively affective form of intentionality. This paper repeats
 those arguments and extends them to thinking about the reactive attitudes:
 emotions like gratitude, resentment, approbation, and guilt. In particular, the
 phenomenology of the reactive attitudes cannot be neatly distinguished from
 the thought that their targets are responsible for <em>wronging</em> or <em>benefiting</em> me. In
 applying my earlier account to the reactive attitudes, I shall make apparent
 commonly ignored aspects of the affectivity of the reactive attitudes, whereby
 they bind us together through our having shared values and communal
 norms.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zG4dML0wbe2gFNaBIyIfzi_XdmJhUOcX" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 in this paper is to step back from an investigation of particular emotions
 and the way such emotions might have social dimensions, thereby bringing
 into view a broader emotional phenomenon—in general, the phenomenon of
 caring—that itself can have social dimensions. I have long argued that caring
 is to be understood in terms of a distinctive rational pattern of emotions.
 In saying that caring itself can have a social dimension, I mean in part
 that the relevant pattern of rationality is one that extends across multiple
 persons, so that what it is rational for me to feel is tied to what it is rational
 for others to feel. This is the case, I shall argue, for the reactive emotions,
 which are emotions, like resentment, indignation, gratitude, approbation,
 and guilt, that we feel in response to the good or ill will one person shows
 to another. For if you resent me, I ought to feel guilty and others ought to
 feel indignation or disapprobation. Indeed, your resentment in effect calls on
 
 
 others to feel these reactive emotions, and (other things being equal) others’
 failure to feel them is a failure properly to respond to you as someone worthy
 of our respect. By examining the interpersonal rational interconnections
 among the reactive emotions, I shall argue that the resulting rational patterns
 constitute that respect which we owe each other and thereby constitute this
 group of people as a community bound together by their mutual respect.
 This is for us to form a community of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcmFSM3gxUmZDa2s&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 attitude—indeed that without self, personal, and vicarious reactive trust
 these practices, this form of human community, and responsible agency
 would not be possible. Moreover, understanding trust in this way helps
 resolve several problems that have confronted philosophers thinking about
 trust, including the distinction between trust and reliance, the conditions of
 the rationality of trust and the nature of trustworthiness, and how my trust

 philosophical theory as recently as 15 years ago and still highly influential
 in psychology today, understand emotions to be essentially clusters of beliefs
 and desires. Thus, cognitivists claim, what it is to be afraid of something is
 to believe it dangerous and want to get away. The intentionality of emotions
 is therefore understood to be dependent on that of the constitutive beliefs
 and desires, and it seems that there is nothing we could call a distinctively
 “affective” intentionality. Indeed, for cognitivists affect is seemingly added
 on as an afterthought: the relevant belief and desire somehow come packaged
 together with a bodily sensation (of a sinking feeling in your gut, for
 example), and it is this packaging of those intentional states with a feeling
 that was supposed to account for their affective nature. As I shall argue,
 such cognitivist accounts of emotions fail to capture the distinctively affective
 character of emotions. A central reason for this failure lies in the kind
 of evaluations that emotions essentially involve. Cognitivist theories must
 understand emotional evaluations to be a part of either the belief or the
 desire; in either case, they are supposed to be intelligible prior to the
 emotions themselves. My contention is that this is false: we cannot make
 sense of these evaluations except in terms of the emotions themselves,
 
 
 and it is this fact about emotions that enables us to understand affective
 intentionality. That is, I shall argue, what is characteristic of affective
 intentionality is that it essentially involves evaluations that are felt, where
 such feelings are simultaneously both responsive to and constitutive of that
 evaluation. Our felt awareness of emotional objects as good or bad in some
 way just is a matter of our being emotionally pleased or pained by these
 objects, and this fact about emotions is central to understanding the nature
 of affective intentionality.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcXRZR0lWNFZWVjQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 irrationality, and nowhere does this irrationality show up more clearly than
 in their effects on motivation. Thus, to take some stereotyped examples,
 fear, anger, and jealousy frequently seem to move us to act contrary to our
 better judgment. Recently, however, there has been increasing emphasis on
 the rationality of emotions and their place in practical reason. Thus, while
 deliberating about what to do, although we may be able to articulate reasons
 for and against each option, we may not be able to say why the weight of
 these reasons favor one over the others; in such cases, we may simply go with
 the one that “feels” right—that resonates more fully with our emotional sense
 of our circumstances—and such an appeal to emotions seems appropriate. I
 argue that emotions are fundamental to motivation and practical reasoning.
 In particular, emotions motivate not because they involve mere dispositions
 to behave but rather because they are rational responses to things we care
 about, responses that sometimes rationally demand intentional action. This,
 together with the way our linguistic concepts can inform these emotional
 responses, makes for rational interconnections with evaluative judgments
 that allow our emotions to play a significant role in our determining what to
 do.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpe-9bF3TjxLqpT5yu1byXd2H_P-bGPD/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 of evaluation that is common to emotions, desires, and (some) bodily
 sensations. These are felt evaluations: passive responses to attend to and
 be motivated by the import of something impressing itself on us, responses
 that are nonetheless simultaneously constitutive of that import by virtue of
 the broader rational patterns of which they are a part and that they serve
 to de?ne. This account of felt evaluations makes sense of the way in which
 pleasures and pains grab our attention and motivate us to act and of the
 peculiar dual objectivity and subjectivity of their implicit evaluations, while
 o?ering a phenomenology adequate to both emotional and bodily pleasures
 and pains.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhRDhCa1AyUUpmUTA&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download.</a></p>

 CNX 149: Race, Gender, and Community.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> Race and gender are centrally important
to each of our lives. But what are they exactly? How many races or genders are there?
Who has what race or what gender? How are these answers determined? (Are race
and gender biologically real? Are they socially constructed? Would their being socially
constructed make them any less real?) How does someone’s race or gender
affect their social position? What injustices do these social positions involve,
and what can or should we do about them? How are these social positions
affected by intersecting social identity categories, including not only race
and gender but also class, sexuality, ability, religion, and more? Drawing
on fields such as philosophy, sociology, women’s and gender studies, and
critical race theory, we will critically examine a variety of answers to these
questions, in the process trying to understand how we can have reasonable and
productive disagreements about these contentious and politically charged issues.

 PHI 250: Philosophy of Mind.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> This class is designed as a general introduction to
the philosophy of mind (and, consequently, as an introduction to the philosophical
side of both majors in the Scientific and Philosophical Studies of Mind program:
Cognitive Science and Moral Psychology). We will begin by examining the mind–body
problem, a problem which arises out of our differing conceptions of the natural world
and of our minds. In particular, science tells us that the body is just a hunk of
physical matter that obeys the laws of nature mechanistically—mindlessly. The
mind, of course, is anything but mindless. So what’s the connection between
the two? How should we conceive of the mind in relation to the body? In
trying to answer this question, we will critically examine several different
 
 
purported solutions to this problem and assess how they fare with respect to
understanding particular issues that arise in the context of this mind–body
problem: the nature of representation, consciousness, psychological explanation,
freedom, and meaning, and identity. In addressing these questions, we shall
gain a clearer understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and implications
of the various theories about what the mind is and its relation to the body.

 PHI 351: Mind-Body Problem.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> It has long been perceived by many philosophers
that there is a problem about the relationship between the mind and the body. The
body, after all, is just a hunk of physical matter that obeys the laws of nature
mechanistically—mindlessly—whereas the mind, of course, is anything but mindless.
So what’s the connection between the two? How do we conceive of the mind in
relation to the body? In this course we’ll examine mostly contemporary accounts of
the relation in an attempt to understand whether there really is a mind–body problem
and, if so, how to solve it. But this course is about more than just the mind and its
place in the broader world; it’s about the nature of that world, too. In the course of
trying to understand how our thoughts can be <em>about</em> anything in the world, we’ll need
to think about the nature of the world such that our thoughts can be about it.

 PHI 352: Philosophy of Emotions.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> Long neglected in philosophy, the emotions have
recently and increasingly come to be seen as important both in their own right and
for their bearing on a wide variety of issues, including (a) the mind–body
problem and the nature of consciousness and intentionality, (b) the nature
of rationality, (c) aesthetics, (d) interpersonal relationships, and (e) moral
psychology and metaethics. My intention in this course is to focus on the
first two such issues, since the other issues are covered more fully in other
courses. However, in doing so it is important that we have a sufficiently rich
understanding of the place emotions can have in our lives, an understanding
that many philosophers and psychologists tend to simplify and diminish.

 PHI 360: Concept of a Person.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> Philosophers tend to understand the concept of a
person in two ways: as a metaphysical notion and as a moral notion. <em>Moral personhood</em>
is roughly an understanding of ourselves as the subjects of moral rights and
responsibilities. By contrast, to understand personhood as a <em>metaphysical</em> notion is to
understand it as delineating a special category of being—as having or being a soul, for
example. Typically, the metaphysical notion of personhood is thought to somehow
underwrite our status as moral persons. Indeed, it is precisely because of this
 
 
explanatory link between them that many philosophers think it is appropriate to
understand the concept of personhood not as having two senses but rather as being
a univocal concept with two aspects. Our aim in this course is to examine
these notions and their interrelations, with an emphasis on our social nature.

responsible moral agents and subjects of value. As such, it is constrained by, and must
cohere with, the facts about human psychology; but its primary focus is on human
good, an evaluative notion. Topics include virtue and character, motivation and
reasons, internal/external reasons and moral development, and responsibility and

 PHI 362: Love and Friendship.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> Love and friendship are undoubtedly important in
our lives … but why? Although we commonly say that we “love” both chocolate cake
and philosophy or that we are “friends” with people on Facebook, these seem to be
thin surrogates for the potentially deep, rich, intimate, and rewarding attitudes
and relationships we develop towards and with other persons. Clearly it is
the latter that we interested in here: forms of love and friendship that apply
paradigmatically to intimate relations among persons. In investigating personal love
and friendship, we will encounter several problems concerning their justification,
their bearing on the autonomy and identity of the individual, and the place
their value has within a broader system of values, including moral values.

 PHI 363: Respect, Responsibility, and Ethics.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> Recently many philosophers have
argued that certain interpersonal emotions, such as resentment, indignation, guilt,
gratitude, and approbation, are fundamental to a host of interconnected issues in
ethics, including the nature of respect, dignity, responsibility and freedom, and the
origins of moral values. This class will closely examine these claims and arguments
with the aim of understanding more clearly how moral psychology and metaethics
intersect. </div></details></div>
