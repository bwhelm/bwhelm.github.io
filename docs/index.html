<!--l. 137--><p class="indent" > <a 
 id="x1-50002"></a>Research</h3>
<!--l. 139--><p class="indent" > The central aim of my research has been to understand more deeply the kind of
rationality characteristic of us persons, and I have argued both (a) that such rationality,
rather than being opposed to the emotions, instead is an essentially emotional
rationality (what I call a “rationality of import”) and (b) that such rationality is not
intelligible apart from our social relations with others. Consequently, I believe it is a
mistake to conceive of us persons as divided into distinct theoretical and practical
sides or to approach understanding personhood via distinct metaphysical and moral
notions. The rationality of import, as I have understood it, is simultaneously both
practical and theoretical: our being the sort of epistemic agents we are rests on our
practical capacities collectively to value (and to hold each other responsible to) public,
objective truth, and our being the sort of moral agents we are depends on our
epistemic abilities to contest and so ultimately to discover what has objective
value. Moreover, the “metaphysical” capacities we have for autonomous,
rational, and responsible agency are capacities we ourselves construct via the
interpersonal commitments to import we collectively undertake. The result is that
through our practical agency, we jointly construct ourselves as persons in
a way that is simultaneously answerable to our experience of personhood
itself.
<!--l. 141--><p class="indent" > I reach this conclusion over the course of three books in which I find moral
psychology and value theory deeply intertwined with philosophy of mind and
emotions and with social ontology. My work is highly systematic, with these books
taking me from a consideration of (1) intrapersonal values and identity, to (2)
interpersonal values in intimate relationships, to (3) communal norms and values in
the context of non-intimate “communities of respect”, all of which lead to my current
research to the objectivity of social identities.

<!--l. 145--><p class="indent" > One characteristic of us persons is that we value things as a part of the kind of life
we each find worth living, thereby partially constituting our identities as the particular
persons we are, such that part of our autonomy consists in our ability to determine
what our values shall be. On the other hand, we persons can also rationally
deliberate about what really is valuable in our lives, thereby potentially coming to
discover who we are. Yet such autonomous invention and rational discovery of
personal values might seem to be in tension with one another (how can personal
values be something we simultaneously both invent and discover?), and this
book aims to resolve that tension by developing an account of the relation
 
 
between emotions and value (or of “<em>import</em>” more generally) that enables me to
reject the rational and ontological priority implicit in this formulation of the
tension.
<!--l. 147--><p class="indent" > In developing this account, I focus not on particular kinds of emotions but rather
on the sorts of <em>rational patterns</em> emotions can form, arguing that such patterns
constitute what it is for things to have import to one. The kind of rationality involved
in these patterns of emotions is what I call a “<em>rationality of import</em>”, and it does not fit
neatly into standard ways of thinking about practical or theoretical rationality. If
we accept (as I do) the Davidsonian thesis that mental capacities are to be
understood in terms of rationality, such a rethinking of rationality means
reconceiving the nature of the mind quite generally and of believing and desiring
in particular. This enables me to make sense of the distinctive rational role
emotions play both in relation to desire and evaluative judgment, thereby
dissolving the above tension, and in relation to motivation, thereby making
intelligible how we can have rational control over what we do and yet be
susceptible to even strong forms of weakness of will. Indeed, I argue that this is
essential to presenting an account of the mind adequate to a serious moral
psychology.

<!--l. 151--><p class="indent" > We persons are social animals, partly insofar as we are able to form intimate
relationships with others and thereby can come to share our lives, our identities, and
our capacity for autonomy with others in relationships of love and friendship. In
this book, I argue against various forms of individualism and egocentrism I
find implicit in many other accounts of love and friendship, and I present an
alternative account of love as intimate identification in terms of <em>interpersonal</em>
rational patterns of emotions. On the one hand this enables me to explain how a
caregiver in a loving relationship with a child can provide the child with access
to reasons (for being neat or for being moral) that otherwise might seem
“external” to the child’s existing motivations. On the other hand, this account of
love enables me to present a rich account of shared agency and ultimately
of friendship in terms of the notions of <em>plural agents</em> (who not only share
certain ends but also the cares motivating those ends) and <em>plural persons</em> (who
share values and hence a conception of the kind of life worth their living
together) and to show how they can, partly through their rationally intertwined
emotions, deliberate together and exercise joint autonomy over their shared
lives.

<!--l. 155--><p class="indent" > To make sense of persons, we must consider as well the <em>non-intimate</em> relationships
we have with others who are in community with us. In this book I join other
Strawsonians in thinking that the reactive attitudes and the ways we <em>hold</em> each other
responsible is central to our being responsible agents at all. Yet in contrast to other
accounts, I reject the explanatory <em>priority</em> of the reactive attitudes over our being
responsible agents: our reactive attitudes are appropriate in part because
they are directed at responsible agents, while simultaneously someone is
a responsible agent because they are an appropriate target of the reactive
attitudes. I make sense of such circularity as non-vicious by appealing to
interpersonal, rational patterns of reactive attitudes, which I argue constitute the
community itself, communal norms and values as <em>our</em> norms and values, and
so individual members of the community as bound by those norms and as
having the authority to hold each other responsible to them. Consequently, we
in the community <em>collectively</em> respect each other as members, and each as
one of us ought therefore to respect the others as members. Such an account
is not second-personal but <em>first-person plural</em>, a conclusion that has several
important implications for the social dimension of us persons. First, <em>responsibility is
social</em>: to be a responsible agent requires that one have the capacity for reactive
attitudes, a capacity that one can develop and sustain only as a member of a
community of respect. Second, <em>rationality is social</em>: insofar as it is we collectively
who have authority over ourselves, we must reject a Humean conception of
practical reason (as depending on one’s “subjective motivation set”, say) and
recognize an essentially social dimension to practical reason and the possible
connections and conflicts among such social reasons and individual reasons
grounded in, for example, personal values. Finally, <em>identity is social</em>: a community
of respect can shape and define certain social identities by prescribing or
proscribing communal values as elements of the kind of life worth its members
living.

<!--l. 159--><p class="indent" > In the last few years I have begun to apply these ideas to the topic of social
construction, especially of social roles and identities. Social roles and identities
presuppose an at least rough-and-ready understanding of them in virtue of
which the various communal norms and values that partly define them hang
together as a coherent whole that can have a point in our lives. Indeed, these
understandings must normally come to inform the patterns of participants’
reactive attitudes constituting those norms and values and hence the role
itself. This makes room for the possibility that participants’ experiences of
themselves as occupants of these roles is inconsistent with the background
understandings and point, providing empirical purchase for rationally contesting
those understandings and hence the norms and roles themselves. Whereas others
think about such contestation as grounded in unjust <em>consequences</em> of these social
roles, my claim is that they can also be grounded in the roles themselves
being <em>ontologically misconstructed</em>. That is, our construction of social roles and
identities can be objective in that our activities of construction can come to be
answerable to the very roles and identities they thereby construct in a way that
opens up the possibility of our getting these roles and identities themselves
wrong.
<!--l. 164--><p class="indent" > Ultimately my aim is to provide an account of moral values as the communal
values of the community of respect of all persons, a community in which
these values and our personhood itself are both socially constructed and
contestable.

 are communities of people sharing common practices or a (partial) way
 
 
 of life; they include families, clubs, religious groups, and political parties.
 This book develops a detailed account of such communities in terms of
 the rational structure of their members’ reactive attitudes, arguing that
 they are fundamental in three interrelated ways to understanding what it
 is to be a person. First, it is only by being a member of a community of
 respect that one can be a responsible agent having dignity; such an agent
 therefore has certain rights as well as the authority to demand that fellow
 members recognize her dignity and follow the norms of the community,
 norms compliance with which they likewise have the authority to demand
 from her. Second, by prescribing or proscribing both actions and values,
 communities of respect can shape the identities of its members in ways
 that others have the authority to enforce, thereby revealing an important
 interpersonal dimension of the identities of persons. Finally, all of this
 is grounded in a distinctively interpersonal form of practical rationality
 in virtue of which we jointly have reasons to recognize the dignity and
 authority of fellow members and so to comply with their authoritative
 demands, as well as to respect (and so comply with) the norms of the
 community. Hence we persons are essentially social creatures.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhR2ZtZ2pqQmZHZ2c" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 Western thought has consistently emphasized the individualistic strand in
 our understanding of persons at the expense of the social strand. Thus, it
 is generally thought that persons are self-determining and autonomous,
 where these are understood to be capacities we exercise most fully on our
 own, apart from others, whose influence on us tends to undermine that
 autonomy. <em>Love, Friendship, and the Self</em> argues that we must reject a strongly
 individualistic conception of persons if we are to make sense of significant
 interpersonal relationships and the importance they can have in our lives. It
 presents a new account of love as intimate identification and of friendship
 as a kind of plural agency, in each case grounding and analyzing these
 notions in terms of interpersonal emotions. At the center of this account is
 an analysis of how our emotional connectedness with others is essential to
 our very capacities for autonomy and self-determination: we are rational
 and autonomous only because of and through our inherently social nature.
 By focusing on the role that relationships of love and friendship have both
 in the initial formation of our selves and in the on-going development and
 maturation of adult persons, Helm significantly alters our understanding
 of persons and the kind of psychology we persons have as moral and social
 beings.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhOTEteU5GeEthckU&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 of which any theory of the emotions can be assessed and reviews the
 central philosophical and psychological versions of cognitivism in light
 of these criteria. Finally, the chapter raises three interrelated problems
 for specifically cognitivist theories of emotions (the problem of circularity,
 the problem of recalcitrance, and the problem of phenomenal unity), and
 suggests that solving them requires blurring or rejecting the distinction

 between <em>personal hate</em>, which targets a particular individual, and <em>impersonal

 focusing on the place hate has within particular sorts of communities,
 enabling a further important distinction between “insider” and “outsider”

 role of emotions in our knowledge of social identities. A central concern
 is to understand how social identities, while being socially constructed,
 can nonetheless be objective in the sense that we can be right or wrong
 not only about what social identities a particular person has but also
 about what social identities there are and how to understand them. Social
 identities are understood as social roles defined by certain communal
 norms and values within a particular kind of community: a community
 of respect. Such norms and values in turn are constructed by complex
 social structures of emotionally grounded, conceptually informed practices
 within the community. It is argued that emotions are simultaneously
 experiences of and commitments to these norms and values, and hence
 that the objectivity of the social identities they construct is possible when
 participants in the community are able to achieve a reflective equilibrium
 among their emotions, the concepts informing these emotions, and a
 theory that both partially articulates these concepts and purports to justify
 the norms and practices to which they are committed via these emotional
 experiences.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1--6BOQLzSc6w3TEBPvVrKuanfquHH8vP/view?usp=sharing" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 we understand the phenomenology of emotions? One standard way is to
 distinguish sharply between their intentionality and their phenomenology,
 
 
 understanding their phenomenology in terms of something like “bodily
 sensations”, which are simply added on to an independent account
 of their intentionality. I have elsewhere (Helm, 2011) argued that this
 strategy fails and that we should instead understand emotions to be
 “felt evaluations”: phenomenological feelings with evaluative content or,
 alternately, a distinctively affective form of intentionality. This paper
 repeats those arguments and extends them to thinking about the reactive
 attitudes: emotions like gratitude, resentment, approbation, and guilt.
 In particular, the phenomenology of the reactive attitudes cannot be

 diversity of kinds of friendship. Setting aside Facebook “friends”—people
 tagged as friends on social media but who are not friends in any
 meaningful sense—the kind of intimacy involved in friendship can vary
 widely, from acquaintance friends to life partners; and the context and
 scope of friendship can likewise vary, from tennis buddies, who meet to
 play once a month, to life partners, who share their lives with each other in
 ways they together find important. Part of the challenge in understanding
 friendship and its value, therefore, lies in recognizing the types or ranges

 University Press, 2018), <a style="overflow-wrap:break-word; font-size:1em;" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190609610.003.0012">(Publisher Link)</a>.<details style="margin-top:.5ex;"><summary><span style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold; color:0c125d;">Abstract</span></summary><span style="font-size:.95em"><p> Tim Scanlon has recently argued that an action
 is <em>blameworthy</em> if it “show[s] something about the agent’s attitudes toward
 others that impairs the relations that others can have with him or her” and
 hence that “to <em>blame</em> a person is to judge him or her to be blameworthy
 and to take your relationship with him or her to be modified in a way
 that this judgment of impaired relations holds to be appropriate” (<em>Moral
 Dimensions</em>, 128–29). Given this, Scanlon argues, reactive attitude accounts
 of blame, while they can capture some of the ways blaming attitudes vary
 depending on one’s relationship to the wrongdoer, are in general “too thin”
 
 
 and cannot explain all the relevant changes in our attitudes, “including
 changes in our readiness to interact with [the wrongdoer] in specific
 ways” (143). Yet Scanlon does not provide clear accounts of what types
 of relationships matter for blame and how violations of the “standards”
 of these relationships justifies what new attitudes. My aim is to address
 this. To do this, we need to turn not merely to particular reactive attitudes
 but to broad, interpersonal rational patterns of reactive attitudes in terms
 of which we can make sense of what I have come to call “communities
 of respect”. My claim is that the sort of relationship whose impairment
 is relevant to blame is that of co-membership in a community of respect,
 so that the significance of the agent’s wrongdoing relevant for blame is
 the significance those actions and attitudes have <em>for us</em> in the community.
 However, accommodating the variability of blame on which Scanlon
 rightly insists requires a more careful examination of two additional factors
 that affect how it is proper for one to respond to the impairment to those
 relationships that the wrongdoing represents: one’s role in a given case
 as perpetrator, victim, or witness, and one’s personal commitments. For,
 I argue, these factors provide one with excuses for failing to treat the
 perpetrator with the normal trust and respect we demand of each other,
 and the validity of these excuses itself depends on the overall rational
 structure of the patterns of reactive attitudes within the community.
 Consequently, both the individual and the community are important
 in defining the relationships and modifications of relationships that are
 central to blame; however, such modifications to personal relationships are
 a <em>consequence</em> of blame rather than, as Scanlon claims, part of its content.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhbTZkbHJwa0xlYnM" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 reactive attitude, gratitude is focused on a particular community of respect,
 subfocused on norms and members of that community, and therefore has
 certain interpersonal, rational connections with other reactive attitudes.
 For this reason, gratitude cannot be understood except in terms of these
 connections to other emotions and to the relevant forms of caring. While
 there is an important sense in which this holistic approach to reactive
 attitudes calls into question the value of analyzing discrete emotions, this
 approach simultaneously sheds light on two traditional problems about
 gratitude. The first concerns whether gratitude requires that the benefactor
 have certain intentions to benefit ( — is benevolence a component of
 gratitude’s formal object?). The second problem is whether gratitude
 is appropriate as a response to obligatory beneficence. A resolution
 to both of these problems is available when consideration is given to
 the interpersonal, rational connections among the reactive attitudes and
 
 
 the role respect plays in this nexus. I conclude by noting the ways in
 which gratitude, like interpersonal trust, serves as a kind of invitation to
 community, and can thereby sustain and deepen the sort of default trust
 presupposed by communities of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1QcPLpTkDUEq5C6wsm9tuhwlop2UQcvZf" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 papers, Haugeland lays out what is both a striking interpretation of
 Heidegger and a compelling account of objectivity and truth. Central to
 his account is a notion of existential commitment: a commitment to insist
 that one’s understanding of the world succeeds in making sense of the
 phenomena and so potentially to change or give up on that understanding
 in the face of apparently impossible phenomena. Although Haugeland
 never gives a clear account of existential commitment, he claims that it is
 fundamentally an individual matter. This, I argue, is a mistake that fails to
 make sense of the public, shared nature of the objective world. Instead, I
 offer an account of existential commitment as one we undertake <em>jointly</em>, and
 I analyze it (and the corresponding responsibility) in terms of interpersonal
 rational patterns of reactive attitudes: emotions like resentment, gratitude,
 indignation, approbation, guilt, and trust. The upshot is that our existential
 commitment is not only to a shared, objective world but also to each
 other such that our ability individually to <em>take</em> responsibility for our
 understanding of the world is intelligible only in terms of others’ being
 able to <em>hold</em> us responsible for it.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhU3FJYThiMFpsQkU&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 reactive attitudes we display in response to each other. In having a reactive
 attitude, one holds its target responsible to certain norms and calls on
 others likewise to hold her responsible, thereby both asserting one’s own
 authority and recognizing the authority of others to demand compliance
 with the norms. When this call is taken up by others, the interpersonal

 an investigation of particular emotions and the way such emotions might
 have social dimensions, thereby bringing into view a broader emotional
 phenomenon—in general, the phenomenon of caring—that itself can have
 social dimensions. I have long argued that caring is to be understood in
 terms of a distinctive rational pattern of emotions. In saying that caring
 itself can have a social dimension, I mean in part that the relevant pattern
 of rationality is one that extends across multiple persons, so that what it is
 rational for me to feel is tied to what it is rational for others to feel. This is
 the case, I shall argue, for the reactive emotions, which are emotions, like
 resentment, indignation, gratitude, approbation, and guilt, that we feel in
 response to the good or ill will one person shows to another. For if you
 resent me, I ought to feel guilty and others ought to feel indignation or
 disapprobation. Indeed, your resentment in effect calls on others to feel
 these reactive emotions, and (other things being equal) others’ failure to
 feel them is a failure properly to respond to you as someone worthy of our
 respect. By examining the interpersonal rational interconnections among
 the reactive emotions, I shall argue that the resulting rational patterns
 constitute that respect which we owe each other and thereby constitute this
 group of people as a community bound together by their mutual respect.
 This is for us to form a community of respect.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcmFSM3gxUmZDa2s&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 care about particular things so that they can develop into responsible
 
 
 adults? This question raises issues both about the status of such reasons
 as “internal” or “external” to the child’s subjective motivational set and
 about the role of adults in guiding children’s choices. In confronting
 this latter question, Tamar Schapiro argues that adults can adopt what
 amounts to a two-pronged strategy: of rewarding or punishing the child
 and of offering explanations and justifications. Such a strategy, however,
 ignores the special role loving caregivers can play in a child’s life. By
 developing an account of such paternalistically loving relationships, I
 show how the caregiver’s conception of the child’s well-being can come
 to inform the child’s own sense of herself and so to provide her with
 essentially interpersonal reasons for caring. Indeed, such reasons can be
 both normatively and motivationally binding on the child even though she
 may not yet be in a position to understand them. That such reasons are
 essentially interpersonal seems to make otiose whether they are “internal”
 or “external,” thereby rendering that distinction less important than we
 might have thought.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lFRH4f-9yzrI9Ask19ZZfMRZ7skIHF3c/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 agency? I want to consider two perspectives we might take in thinking
 about responsibility, what we might call an inner and an outer perspective.
 The <em>inner perspective</em> is that of the agent herself, involving her having and
 exercising (or failing to exercise) certain agential capacities and so choosing
 and controlling her actions. The <em>outer perspective</em> is that from which we
 assess someone’s conduct and—crucially—her will as a matter of holding
 her to account. In each case, responsibility is always to a certain set of
 norms. From the internal perspective, these are norms that are <em>binding</em>
 on her (or to which she binds herself); from the outer perspective these
 are norms in terms of which we assess her and so to which we <em>hold</em> her.
 My aim in this paper is to argue that the inner perspective does not have
 priority over the outer perspective and thus that the theoretical approach
 is mistaken: our ability, prominent from the inner perspective, to take
 responsibility and so to hold ourselves accountable is not intelligible apart
 from our having a place in a broader community in which others hold
 us accountable. This idea, of course, is familiar to readers of Strawson’s
 “Freedom and Resentment”. However, unlike Strawson, I do not think this
 implies that the outer perspective is prior to the inner, for ultimately I
 think we cannot make sense of an agent’s being properly held accountable
 unless he can take responsibility for his actions in a way that ultimately
 presupposes his freedom. This is not something I can argue here; rather,
 my claim will be that we cannot understand an agent’s being accountable
 as depending simply on the agent herself; rather, accountable agency
 depends on capacities that are essentially social.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhRWsxaExMaXJtODQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 dominant philosophical theory as recently as 15 years ago and still highly
 influential in psychology today, understand emotions to be essentially
 clusters of beliefs and desires. Thus, cognitivists claim, what it is to be
 afraid of something is to believe it dangerous and want to get away. The
 intentionality of emotions is therefore understood to be dependent on that
 of the constitutive beliefs and desires, and it seems that there is nothing we
 could call a distinctively “affective” intentionality. Indeed, for cognitivists
 affect is seemingly added on as an afterthought: the relevant belief and
 desire somehow come packaged together with a bodily sensation (of a
 sinking feeling in your gut, for example), and it is this packaging of those
 intentional states with a feeling that was supposed to account for their
 affective nature. As I shall argue, such cognitivist accounts of emotions fail
 to capture the distinctively affective character of emotions. A central reason
 for this failure lies in the kind of evaluations that emotions essentially
 involve. Cognitivist theories must understand emotional evaluations to be
 a part of either the belief or the desire; in either case, they are supposed
 to be intelligible prior to the emotions themselves. My contention is
 that this is false: we cannot make sense of these evaluations except in
 terms of the emotions themselves, and it is this fact about emotions that
 enables us to understand affective intentionality. That is, I shall argue,
 what is characteristic of affective intentionality is that it essentially involves
 evaluations that are felt, where such feelings are simultaneously both
 
 
 responsive to and constitutive of that evaluation. Our felt awareness of
 emotional objects as good or bad in some way just is a matter of our
 being emotionally pleased or pained by these objects, and this fact about
 emotions is central to understanding the nature of affective intentionality.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhcXRZR0lWNFZWVjQ&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 intimate form of concern in which we in some sense identify with our
 beloveds; it is common, moreover, to construe such identification in terms
 of the lover’s taking on the interests of the beloved. From this starting
 point, Harry Frankfurt argues that the paradigm form of love is that
 between parents and infants or young children. I think this is mistaken:
 the kind of loving attitude or relationship we can have towards or with
 young children is distinct in kind from that which we can have towards
 adult persons, as is revealed by reflection on the depth of love and its
 phenomenology. My aim is to present an alternative conception of the sort
 of distinctively intimate identification at issue in love, arguing that this
 account makes better sense of love and our experience of love.</span></details>

 Authenticity, it is plausible to suppose, is a feature of one’s identity as a
 person—of one’s sense of the kind of life worth living. Most attempts to
 explicate this notion of a person’s identity do so in terms of an antecedent
 understanding of what it is for a person to value something. This is, I
 argue, a mistake: a concern is not intelligible as a value apart from the place
 it has within a larger identity that the value serves in turn to constitute;
 to assume otherwise is to risk leaving out the very person whose identity
 these values allegedly constitute. By contrast, I offer an account of values
 as always already a part of one’s identity. I do so by providing an analysis
 of values in terms of what I call ’person-focused emotions,’ emotions like
 pride and shame. Such emotions, I argue, involve a commitment to the
 import of a person primarily and, only secondarily, to things valued, and
 in this way enable us to understand what it is to value these things for the
 sake of the person. The upshot is a more satisfying account of a person’s
 identity and values, an account that can provide the necessary background
 for a more thorough investigation of authenticity.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhUF95eHljajJmbWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 notorious for their irrationality, and nowhere does this irrationality show
 up more clearly than in their effects on motivation. Thus, to take some
 stereotyped examples, fear, anger, and jealousy frequently seem to move
 us to act contrary to our better judgment. Recently, however, there has
 been increasing emphasis on the rationality of emotions and their place in
 practical reason. Thus, while deliberating about what to do, although we
 may be able to articulate reasons for and against each option, we may not
 be able to say why the weight of these reasons favor one over the others;
 in such cases, we may simply go with the one that “feels” right—that
 resonates more fully with our emotional sense of our circumstances—and
 such an appeal to emotions seems appropriate. I argue that emotions are
 fundamental to motivation and practical reasoning. In particular, emotions
 motivate not because they involve mere dispositions to behave but rather
 because they are rational responses to things we care about, responses
 that sometimes rationally demand intentional action. This, together with
 the way our linguistic concepts can inform these emotional responses,
 makes for rational interconnections with evaluative judgments that allow
 our emotions to play a significant role in our determining what to do.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhc2RyYVM1ODVXbFU&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 understood in terms of bodily sensations they involve. This is a mistake.
 We should instead understand their phenomenology in terms of their
 distinctively evaluative intentionality. Emotions are essentially affective
 modes of response to the ways our circumstances come to matter to us,
 and so they are ways of being pleased or pained by those circumstances.
 Making sense of the intentionality and phenomenology of emotions in
 this way requires rejecting traditional understandings of intentionality
 and so coming to see emotions as a distinctive and irreducible class of
 mental states lying at the intersection of intentionality, phenomenology,
 and motivation.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpe-9bF3TjxLqpT5yu1byXd2H_P-bGPD/view?usp=drive_link" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 Genuine agents are able to engage in activity because they find it
 worth pursuing—because they care about it. In this respect, they
 differ from what might be called “mere intentional systems”: systems
 like chess-playing computers that exhibit merely goal-directed behavior
 mediated by instrumental rationality, without caring. A parallel distinction
 can be made in the domain of social activity: plural agents must be
 distinguished from plural intentional systems in that plural agents have
 cares and engage in activity because of those cares. In this paper, I sketch
 an account of what it is for an individual to care about things in terms of
 her exhibiting a certain pattern of emotions. After extending this account
 to make sense of an individual’s caring about other agents, I then show
 how a certain sort of emotional connectedness among a group of people
 can make intelligible the group’s having cares and thereby constitute that
 group as a plural agent. Alternative accounts of social action, by ignoring
 the difference between mere intentional systems and genuine agents, and
 so by leaving out these emotional entanglements from their accounts of
 social action, thereby fail to capture a whole range of social phenomena
 involving plural agents.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhdnA3MU1UeVdKTWM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 that pleasure and pains are not qualia and they are not to be analyzed
 in terms of supposedly antecedently intelligible mental states like bodily
 sensation or desire. Rather, pleasure and pain are characteristic of a
 distinctive kind of evaluation that is common to emotions, desires, and
 (some) bodily sensations. These are felt evaluations: passive responses to
 attend to and be motivated by the import of something impressing itself
 on us, responses that are nonetheless simultaneously constitutive of that
 import by virtue of the broader rational patterns of which they are a part
 and that they serve to de?ne. This account of felt evaluations makes sense
 of the way in which pleasures and pains grab our attention and motivate us
 to act and of the peculiar dual objectivity and subjectivity of their implicit
 evaluations, while o?ering a phenomenology adequate to both emotional
 and bodily pleasures and pains.</span></details> Reprinted as <a

 is the problem of understanding how we can have rational control over
 what we do. In the face of phenomena like weakness of the will, it
 is commonly thought that evaluation and reason can always remain
 intact even as we sever their connection with motivation; consequently,
 solving the motivational problem is thought to be a matter of figuring
 out how to bridge this inevitable gap between evaluation and motivation.
 I argue that this is fundamentally mistaken and results in a conception
 
 
 of practical reason that is motivationally impotent. Instead, I argue, a
 proper understanding of evaluation and practical reason must include
 not only evaluative judgments but emotions as well. By analyzing the
 role of emotions in evaluation and the rational interconnections among
 emotions, desires, and evaluative judgments, I articulate a new conception
 of evaluation and motivation according to which there is a conceptual
 connection between them, albeit one that allows for the possibility of
 weakness of the will.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhV0lvU2o1blhiY2c&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 about personal, non-moral values involves elements of both invention and
 discovery. Thus, we invent our values by freely choosing them, where
 such distinctively human freedom is essential to our defining and taking
 responsibility for the kinds of persons we are; nonetheless, we also discover
 our values insofar as we can deliberate about them rationally and arrive
 at non-arbitrary decisions about what has value in our lives. Yet these
 notions of invention and discovery seem inconsistent with each other, and
 the possibility of deliberation about value therefore seems paradoxical.
 My aim is to argue that this apparent paradox is no paradox at all. I
 offer an account of what it is to value something largely in terms of
 emotions and desires. By examining the rational interconnections among
 emotions and evaluative judgments, I argue for an account both of how
 judgments can shape our emotions, thereby shaping our values in a way
 that makes intelligible the possibility of inventing our values, and of how
 our emotions can simultaneously rationally constrain correct deliberation,
 thereby making intelligible the possibility of discovering our values. The
 result is a rejection of both cognitivist and non-cognitivist accounts of value
 and deliberation about value.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B45uPWgGHVLhM1lwNVprU0toRmM&amp;authuser=0" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 account of causation have received so little attention in the secondary
 literature on the subject. The first is the distinction of causation into the
 natural and the philosophical relations: Although many have tried to give
 accounts of why Hume presents two definitions of causality, it is often
 not clear in these accounts that the one definition is of causality as a
 natural relation and the other is of causality as a philosophical relation,
 where to make the contrast between these two kinds of relations we
 need to give a naturalistic account of natural relations and a normative
 account of philosophical relations. (That Hume intends this to be the
 contrast will be defended in more detail below.) The second element is
 that, in many cases of our inferences from cause to effect, “we must
 follow our taste and sentiment” (A Treatise of Human Nature [T], 103),
 where the appeal to taste here, as in morality and aesthetics, is not to
 be understood as up to the individual. Rather, Hume makes it clear both
 in Book 3 of the Treatise and in “Of the Standard of Taste” that there
 are standards to which our individual judgments (in morality, aesthetics,
 or causality) must conform. My purpose in this paper is to attempt to
 provide an interpretation of Hume’s account of causality that brings these
 two elements explicitly into the foreground. This interpretation is, to a
 greater extent than usual, a reconstruction of Hume’s account of our causal
 inferences, drawing, as I have indicated above, from a range of texts not
 normally associated with Hume’s discussion of causality. As such, this
 interpretation should be considered as exploratory in nature, perhaps
 focussing too single-mindedly on these two elements in an attempt to
 make out as strong a case as possible for their relevance in understanding
 Hume’s account of causal inference.</span></details> <p style="margin-bottom:1.5ex;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0bmKWBSS4XPGUaNENHaf9il3jVI09Og/view?usp=sharing" style="font-family:sans-serif; font-weight:bold;">Download</a></p>

 CNX 149: Race, Gender, and Community.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">Race and gender are centrally important
to each of our lives. But what are they exactly? How many races or genders are there?
Who has what race or what gender? How are these answers determined? (Are race
and gender biologically real? Are they socially constructed? Would their being socially
constructed make them any less real?) How does someone’s race or gender
affect their social position? What injustices do these social positions involve,
and what can or should we do about them? How are these social positions
affected by intersecting social identity categories, including not only race
and gender but also class, sexuality, ability, religion, and more? Drawing
on fields such as philosophy, sociology, women’s and gender studies, and
critical race theory, we will critically examine a variety of answers to these
questions, in the process trying to understand how we can have reasonable and
productive disagreements about these contentious and politically charged
issues.</div></details></div>

 SPM 100: Minds, Machines, and Morals.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">This course provides an introduction to
some central problems, concepts, and methods of cognitive science and moral
psychology. We will address questions concerning the nature of intelligence, the
relationship between minds and bodies, and the basis of moral beliefs and behaviors.
These explorations will bridge the sciences and humanities by taking a fundamentally
interdisciplinary perspective.</div></details></div>

 PHI 250: Philosophy of Mind.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">This class is designed as a general introduction to the
philosophy of mind (and, consequently, as an introduction to the philosophical side of
both majors in the Scientific and Philosophical Studies of Mind program: Cognitive
Science and Moral Psychology). We will begin by examining the mind–body problem,
a problem which arises out of our differing conceptions of the natural world and of
our minds. In particular, science tells us that the body is just a hunk of physical matter
that obeys the laws of nature mechanistically—mindlessly. The mind, of course, is
anything but mindless. So what’s the connection between the two? How should we
conceive of the mind in relation to the body? In trying to answer this question, we will
critically examine several different purported solutions to this problem and assess
 
 
how they fare with respect to understanding particular issues that arise in the
context of this mind–body problem: the nature of representation, consciousness,
psychological explanation, freedom, and meaning, and identity. In addressing these
questions, we shall gain a clearer understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and
implications of the various theories about what the mind is and its relation to the
body.</div></details></div>

 PHI 351: Mind-Body Problem.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">It has long been perceived by many philosophers
that there is a problem about the relationship between the mind and the body. The
body, after all, is just a hunk of physical matter that obeys the laws of nature
mechanistically—mindlessly—whereas the mind, of course, is anything but mindless.
So what’s the connection between the two? How do we conceive of the mind in
relation to the body? In this course we’ll examine mostly contemporary accounts of
the relation in an attempt to understand whether there really is a mind–body problem
and, if so, how to solve it. But this course is about more than just the mind and its
place in the broader world; it’s about the nature of that world, too. In the course of
trying to understand how our thoughts can be <em>about</em> anything in the world, we’ll need
to think about the nature of the world such that our thoughts can be about
it.</div></details></div>

 PHI 352: Philosophy of Emotions.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">Long neglected in philosophy, the emotions
have recently and increasingly come to be seen as important both in their
own right and for their bearing on a wide variety of issues, including (a)
the mind–body problem and the nature of consciousness and intentionality,
(b) the nature of rationality, (c) aesthetics, (d) interpersonal relationships,
and (e) moral psychology and metaethics. My intention in this course is to
focus on the first two such issues, since the other issues are covered more
fully in other courses. However, in doing so it is important that we have a
sufficiently rich understanding of the place emotions can have in our lives, an
understanding that many philosophers and psychologists tend to simplify and
diminish.</div></details></div>

 PHI 360: Concept of a Person.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">Philosophers tend to understand the concept of a
person in two ways: as a metaphysical notion and as a moral notion. <em>Moral personhood</em>
is roughly an understanding of ourselves as the subjects of moral rights and
responsibilities. By contrast, to understand personhood as a <em>metaphysical</em> notion is to
understand it as delineating a special category of being—as having or being a soul, for
example. Typically, the metaphysical notion of personhood is thought to somehow
underwrite our status as moral persons. Indeed, it is precisely because of this
explanatory link between them that many philosophers think it is appropriate to
 
 
understand the concept of personhood not as having two senses but rather
as being a univocal concept with two aspects. Our aim in this course is to
examine these notions and their interrelations, with an emphasis on our social
nature.</div></details></div>

<summary style="font-weight:bold; font-family:sans-serif;">
 PHI 361: Moral Psychology.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">Moral psychology is the study of us persons as
responsible moral agents and subjects of value. As such, it is constrained by, and must
cohere with, the facts about human psychology; but its primary focus is on human
good, an evaluative notion. Topics include virtue and character, motivation and
reasons, internal/external reasons and moral development, and responsibility and
blame.</div></details></div>

<details>
<summary style="font-weight:bold; font-family:sans-serif;">
 PHI 362: Love and Friendship.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em">Love and friendship are undoubtedly important in
our lives … but why? Although we commonly say that we “love” both chocolate cake
and philosophy or that we are “friends” with people on Facebook, these seem to be
thin surrogates for the potentially deep, rich, intimate, and rewarding attitudes
and relationships we develop towards and with other persons. Clearly it is
the latter that we interested in here: forms of love and friendship that apply
paradigmatically to intimate relations among persons. In investigating personal
love and friendship, we will encounter several problems concerning their
justification, their bearing on the autonomy and identity of the individual, and the
place their value has within a broader system of values, including moral
values.</div></details></div>
<div style="text-align:left; margin-top:1ex">
<details>
<summary style="font-weight:bold; font-family:sans-serif;">
 PHI 363: Respect, Responsibility, and Ethics.</summary><div style="margin-left:1.33em"> Recently many philosophers have
argued that certain interpersonal emotions, such as resentment, indignation, guilt,
gratitude, and approbation, are fundamental to a host of interconnected issues in
ethics, including the nature of respect, dignity, responsibility and freedom, and the
origins of moral values. This class will closely examine these claims and arguments
with the aim of understanding more clearly how moral psychology and metaethics
intersect. </div></details></div>
