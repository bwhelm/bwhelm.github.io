 id="x1-50002"></a>Research</h3>
<!--l. 205--><p class="indent" >   The central aim of my research has been to understand more deeply the kind of
rationality characteristic of us persons, and I have argued both (a) that such rationality,
rather than being opposed to the emotions, instead is an essentially emotional
rationality (what I call a “rationality of import”) and (b) that such rationality is not
intelligible apart from our social relations with others. Consequently, I believe it is a
mistake to conceive of us persons as divided into distinct theoretical and practical
sides or to approach understanding personhood via distinct metaphysical and moral
notions. The rationality of import, as I have understood it, is simultaneously both
practical and theoretical: our being the sort of epistemic agents we are rests on our
practical capacities collectively to value (and to hold each other responsible to) public,
objective truth, and our being the sort of moral agents we are depends on our
epistemic abilities to contest and so ultimately to discover what has objective
                                                                          
                                                                          
value. Moreover, the “metaphysical” capacities we have for autonomous,
rational, and responsible agency are capacities we ourselves construct via the
interpersonal commitments to import we collectively undertake. The result is that
through our practical agency, we jointly construct ourselves as persons in
a way that is simultaneously answerable to our experience of personhood
itself.
<!--l. 207--><p class="indent" >   I reach this conclusion over the course of three books in which I find moral
psychology and value theory deeply intertwined with philosophy of mind and
emotions and with social ontology. My work is highly systematic, with these books
taking me from a consideration of (1) intrapersonal values and identity, to (2)
interpersonal values in intimate relationships, to (3) communal norms and values in
the context of non-intimate “communities of respect”, all of which lead to my current
research to the objectivity of social identities.

<!--l. 211--><p class="indent" >   One characteristic of us persons is that we value things as a part of the kind of life
we each find worth living, thereby partially constituting our identities as the particular
persons we are, such that part of our autonomy consists in our ability to determine
what our values shall be. On the other hand, we persons can also rationally
deliberate about what really is valuable in our lives, thereby potentially coming to
discover who we are. Yet such autonomous invention and rational discovery of
personal values might seem to be in tension with one another (how can personal
values be something we simultaneously both invent and discover?), and this
book aims to resolve that tension by developing an account of the relation
between emotions and value (or of “<span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">import</span>” more generally) that enables me to
reject the rational and ontological priority implicit in this formulation of the
tension.
<!--l. 213--><p class="indent" >   In developing this account, I focus not on particular kinds of emotions but rather
on the sorts of <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">rational patterns </span>emotions can form, arguing that such patterns
constitute what it is for things to have import to one. The kind of rationality involved
in these patterns of emotions is what I call a “<span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">rationality of import</span>”, and it does not fit
neatly into standard ways of thinking about practical or theoretical rationality. If
we accept (as I do) the Davidsonian thesis that mental capacities are to be
understood in terms of rationality, such a rethinking of rationality means
reconceiving the nature of the mind quite generally and of believing and desiring
in particular. This enables me to make sense of the distinctive rational role
emotions play both in relation to desire and evaluative judgment, thereby
dissolving the above tension, and in relation to motivation, thereby making
intelligible how we can have rational control over what we do and yet be
susceptible to even strong forms of weakness of will. Indeed, I argue that this is
essential to presenting an account of the mind adequate to a serious moral

<!--l. 224--><p class="indent" >   We persons are social animals, partly insofar as we are able to form intimate
relationships with others and thereby can come to share our lives, our identities, and
our capacity for autonomy with others in relationships of love and friendship. In
this book, I argue against various forms of individualism and egocentrism I
find implicit in many other accounts of love and friendship, and I present an
alternative account of love as intimate identification in terms of <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">interpersonal</span>
rational patterns of emotions. On the one hand this enables me to explain how a
caregiver in a loving relationship with a child can provide the child with access
to reasons (for being neat or for being moral) that otherwise might seem
“external” to the child’s existing motivations. On the other hand, this account of
love enables me to present a rich account of shared agency and ultimately
of friendship in terms of the notions of <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">plural agents </span>(who not only share
certain ends but also the cares motivating those ends) and <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">plural persons </span>(who
share values and hence a conception of the kind of life worth their living
together) and to show how they can, partly through their rationally intertwined
emotions, deliberate together and exercise joint autonomy over their shared
lives.

<!--l. 228--><p class="indent" >   To make sense of persons, we must consider as well the <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">non-intimate </span>relationships
we have with others who are in community with us. In this book I join other
Strawsonians in thinking that the reactive attitudes and the ways we <span

responsible are central to our <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">being </span>responsible agents at all. Yet in contrast to other
accounts, I reject the explanatory priority of the reactive attitudes over our being
responsible agents: our reactive attitudes are appropriate in part because they are
directed at responsible agents, while simultaneously someone is a responsible
agent because they are an appropriate target of the reactive attitudes. I make
                                                                          
                                                                          
sense of such circularity as non-vicious by appealing to interpersonal, rational
patterns of reactive attitudes, which I argue constitute the community itself,
communal norms and values as <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">our </span>norms and values, and so individual members
of the community as bound by those norms and as having the authority to
hold each other responsible to them. Consequently, we in the community
<span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">collectively </span>respect each other as members, and each as one of us ought therefore
to respect the others as members. Such an account is not second-personal
but <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">first-person plural</span>, a conclusion that has several important implications
for the social dimension of us persons. First, <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">responsibility is social</span>: to be a
responsible agent requires that one have the capacity for reactive attitudes, a
capacity that one can develop and sustain only as a member of a community of
respect. Second, <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">rationality has a social dimension</span>: insofar as it is we collectively
who have authority over ourselves, we must reject a Humean conception of
practical reason (as depending on one’s “subjective motivation set”, say) and
recognize an essentially social dimension to practical reason and the possible
connections and conflicts among such social reasons and individual reasons
grounded in, for example, personal values. Finally, <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">identity is social</span>: a community
of respect can shape and define certain social identities by prescribing or
proscribing communal values as elements of the kind of life worth its members
living.

<!--l. 234--><p class="noindent" ><span 
class="pplb9d-x-x-109">Recent Work. </span>In the last few years I have begun to apply these ideas to the topic of
social construction, especially of social roles and identities. Social roles and identities
presuppose an at least rough-and-ready understanding of them in virtue of
which the various communal norms and values that partly define them hang
together as a coherent whole that can have a point in our lives. Indeed, these
understandings must normally come to inform the patterns of participants’
reactive attitudes constituting those norms and values and hence the role
itself. This makes room for the possibility that participants’ experiences of
themselves as occupants of these roles is inconsistent with the background
understandings and point, providing empirical purchase for rationally contesting
those understandings and hence the norms and roles themselves. Whereas others
think about such contestation as grounded in unjust <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">consequences </span>of these social
roles, my claim is that they can also be grounded in the roles themselves
being <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">ontologically misconstructed</span>. That is, our construction of social roles and
identities can be objective in that our activities of construction can come to be
answerable to the very roles and identities they thereby construct in a way that
opens up the possibility of our getting these roles and identities themselves
wrong.

   of respect are communities of people sharing common practices or a (partial)
   way  of  life;  they  include  families,  clubs,  religious  groups,  and  political
   parties. This book develops a detailed account of such communities in terms
   of the rational structure of their members’ reactive attitudes, arguing that
   they are fundamental in three interrelated ways to understanding what it
   is  to  be  a  person.  First,  it  is  only  by  being  a  member  of  a  community  of
   respect that one can be a responsible agent having dignity; such an agent
   therefore has certain rights as well as the authority to demand that fellow
   members  recognize  her  dignity  and  follow  the  norms  of  the  community,
   norms compliance with which they likewise have the authority to demand
   from  her.  Second,  by  prescribing  or  proscribing  both  actions  and  values,
   communities  of  respect  can  shape  the  identities  of  its  members  in  ways
   that  others  have  the  authority  to  enforce,  thereby  revealing  an  important
   interpersonal  dimension  of  the  identities  of  persons.  Finally,  all  of  this  is
   grounded  in  a  distinctively  interpersonal  form  of  practical  rationality  in
   virtue of which we jointly have reasons to recognize the dignity and authority
   of fellow members and so to comply with their authoritative demands, as
   well as to respect (and so comply with) the norms of the community. Hence
   we persons are essentially social creatures.</span></details>

   presents a new account of love as intimate identification and of friendship
   as  a  kind  of  plural  agency,  in  each  case  grounding  and  analyzing  these
   notions  in  terms  of  interpersonal  emotions.  At  the  center  of  this  account
   is an analysis of how our emotional connectedness with others is essential
   to our very capacities for autonomy and self-determination: we are rational
   and autonomous only because of and through our inherently social nature.
   By focusing on the role that relationships of love and friendship have both
   in the initial formation of our selves and in the on-going development and
   maturation of adult persons, Helm significantly alters our understanding of
   persons and the kind of psychology we persons have as moral and social
   beings.</span></details>

   theories  of  emotions  understand  emotions  to  be  caused  or  constituted  by

   chapter identifies some criteria in terms of which any theory of the emotions
   can  be  assessed  and  reviews  the  central  philosophical  and  psychological
   versions of cognitivism in light of these criteria. Finally, the chapter raises
   three interrelated problems for specifically cognitivist theories of emotions
   (the  problem  of  circularity,  the  problem  of  recalcitrance,  and  the  problem
   of phenomenal unity), and suggests that solving them requires blurring or

   understand  the  role  of  emotions  in  our  knowledge  of  social  identities.  A
   central concern is to understand how social identities, while being socially
   constructed, can nonetheless be objective in the sense that we can be right
   or wrong not only about what social identities a particular person has but
   also  about  what  social  identities  there  are  and  how  to  understand  them.
   Social identities are understood as social roles defined by certain communal
   norms and values within a particular kind of community: a community of
   respect. Such norms and values in turn are constructed by complex social
   structures of emotionally grounded, conceptually informed practices within
   the community. It is argued that emotions are simultaneously experiences of
   and commitments to these norms and values, and hence that the objectivity
   of  the  social  identities  they  construct  is  possible  when  participants  in  the
   community are able to achieve a reflective equilibrium among their emotions,
   the  concepts  informing  these  emotions,  and  a  theory  that  both  partially
   articulates these concepts and purports to justify the norms and practices to
   which they are committed via these emotional experiences.</span></details>

   of  “<span

   the target of hate, identifying oneself as not being what they are. Fleshing

   Moreover, impersonal hate requires focusing on the place hate has within
   particular  sorts  of  communities,  enabling  a  further  important  distinction
   between “insider” and “outsider” hate in terms of whether the hater includes
   members of the targeted group within a particular community or rejects them
   as “beneath” membership in that community.</span></details>

   understand  the  phenomenology  of  emotions?  One  standard  way  is  to
   distinguish sharply between their intentionality and their phenomenology,
   understanding  their  phenomenology  in  terms  of  something  like  “bodily
   sensations”,   which   are   simply   added   on   to   an   independent   account
   of  their  intentionality.  I  have  elsewhere  (Helm,  2011)  argued  that  this
   strategy  fails  and  that  we  should  instead  understand  emotions  to  be
   “felt  evaluations”:  phenomenological  feelings  with  evaluative  content  or,
   alternately, a distinctively affective form of intentionality. This paper repeats
   those arguments and extends them to thinking about the reactive attitudes:
   emotions like gratitude, resentment, approbation, and guilt. In particular, the
   phenomenology of the reactive attitudes cannot be neatly distinguished from
   the thought that their targets are responsible for <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">wronging </span>or <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">benefiting </span>me. In
   applying my earlier account to the reactive attitudes, I shall make apparent
   commonly ignored aspects of the affectivity of the reactive attitudes, whereby
   they  bind  us  together  through  our  having  shared  values  and  communal
   norms.</span></details>

   mistake  that  ignores  the  social  significance  not  only  of  the  benefactor’s

   broader interpersonal patterns of reactive attitudes, I argue that gratitude
   is better understood as itself a commitment to communal norms defining
   how we ought to manifest respect towards each other and as an invitation
   to others likewise to commit to these norms. Such norms thus define the
   social significance of that for which one is grateful, thereby sustaining and

   <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">blameworthy  </span>if  it  “show[s]  something  about  the  agent’s  attitudes  toward
   others that impairs the relations that others can have with him or her” and
   hence that “to <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">blame </span>a person is to judge him or her to be blameworthy and
   to take your relationship with him or her to be modified in a way that this
   judgment of impaired relations holds to be appropriate” (<span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">Moral Dimensions</span>,
   128–29).  Given  this,  Scanlon  argues,  reactive  attitude  accounts  of  blame,
   while they can capture some of the ways blaming attitudes vary depending
   on one’s relationship to the wrongdoer, are in general “too thin” and cannot
   explain  all  the  relevant  changes  in  our  attitudes,  “including  changes  in
   our readiness to interact with [the wrongdoer] in specific ways” (143). Yet
   Scanlon  does  not  provide  clear  accounts  of  what  types  of  relationships
   matter for blame and how violations of the “standards” of these relationships
   justifies what new attitudes. My aim is to address this. To do this, we need
   to turn not merely to particular reactive attitudes but to broad, interpersonal
   rational patterns of reactive attitudes in terms of which we can make sense
   of  what  I  have  come  to  call  “communities  of  respect”.  My  claim  is  that
   the  sort  of  relationship  whose  impairment  is  relevant  to  blame  is  that  of
   co-membership  in  a  community  of  respect,  so  that  the  significance  of  the
   agent’s  wrongdoing  relevant  for  blame  is  the  significance  those  actions
   and attitudes have <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">for us  </span>in the community. However, accommodating the
   variability of blame on which Scanlon rightly insists requires a more careful
   examination of two additional factors that affect how it is proper for one
   to  respond  to  the  impairment  to  those  relationships  that  the  wrongdoing
   represents:  one’s  role  in  a  given  case  as  perpetrator,  victim,  or  witness,
   and  one’s  personal  commitments.  For,  I  argue,  these  factors  provide  one
   with  excuses  for  failing  to  treat  the  perpetrator  with  the  normal  trust
   and  respect  we  demand  of  each  other,  and  the  validity  of  these  excuses
   itself  depends  on  the  overall  rational  structure  of  the  patterns  of  reactive
                                                                          
                                                                          
   attitudes within the community. Consequently, both the individual and the
   community  are  important  in  defining  the  relationships  and  modifications
   of  relationships  that  are  central  to  blame;  however,  such  modifications  to
   personal  relationships  are  a  <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">consequence  </span>of  blame  rather  than,  as  Scanlon
   claims, part of its content.</span></details>

   of  papers,  Haugeland  lays  out  what  is  both  a  striking  interpretation  of
   Heidegger  and  a  compelling  account  of  objectivity  and  truth.  Central  to
   his account is a notion of existential commitment: a commitment to insist
   that  one’s  understanding  of  the  world  succeeds  in  making  sense  of  the
   phenomena and so potentially to change or give up on that understanding
   in  the  face  of  apparently  impossible  phenomena.  Although  Haugeland
   never gives a clear account of existential commitment, he claims that it is
   fundamentally an individual matter. This, I argue, is a mistake that fails to
   make sense of the public, shared nature of the objective world. Instead, I
   offer an account of existential commitment as one we undertake <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">jointly</span>, and
   I analyze it (and the corresponding responsibility) in terms of interpersonal
   rational patterns of reactive attitudes: emotions like resentment, gratitude,
   indignation, approbation, guilt, and trust. The upshot is that our existential
   commitment is not only to a shared, objective world but also to each other
   such that our ability individually to <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">take </span>responsibility for our understanding
   of  the  world  is  intelligible  only  in  terms  of  others’  being  able  to  <span

   an investigation of particular emotions and the way such emotions might
   have  social  dimensions,  thereby  bringing  into  view  a  broader  emotional
   phenomenon—in general, the phenomenon of caring—that itself can have
   social dimensions. I have long argued that caring is to be understood in terms
   of a distinctive rational pattern of emotions. In saying that caring itself can
   have a social dimension, I mean in part that the relevant pattern of rationality
   is one that extends across multiple persons, so that what it is rational for
   me to feel is tied to what it is rational for others to feel. This is the case, I
   shall argue, for the reactive emotions, which are emotions, like resentment,
   indignation, gratitude, approbation, and guilt, that we feel in response to the
   good or ill will one person shows to another. For if you resent me, I ought
   to feel guilty and others ought to feel indignation or disapprobation. Indeed,
   your resentment in effect calls on others to feel these reactive emotions, and
                                                                          
                                                                          
   (other things being equal) others’ failure to feel them is a failure properly
   to  respond  to  you  as  someone  worthy  of  our  respect.  By  examining  the
   interpersonal rational interconnections among the reactive emotions, I shall
   argue that the resulting rational patterns constitute that respect which we
   owe each other and thereby constitute this group of people as a community
   bound together by their mutual respect. This is for us to form a community
   of respect.</span></details>

   particular  things  so  that  they  can  develop  into  responsible  adults?  This
   question  raises  issues  both  about  the  status  of  such  reasons  as  “internal”
   or  “external”  to  the  child’s  subjective  motivational  set  and  about  the  role
   of adults in guiding children’s choices. In confronting this latter question,
   Tamar Schapiro argues that adults can adopt what amounts to a two-pronged
   strategy: of rewarding or punishing the child and of offering explanations
   and justifications. Such a strategy, however, ignores the special role loving
   caregivers  can  play  in  a  child’s  life.  By  developing  an  account  of  such
   paternalistically loving relationships, I show how the caregiver’s conception
   of the child’s well-being can come to inform the child’s own sense of herself
   and  so  to  provide  her  with  essentially  interpersonal  reasons  for  caring.
   Indeed, such reasons can be both normatively and motivationally binding
   on the child even though she may not yet be in a position to understand
   them. That such reasons are essentially interpersonal seems to make otiose
   whether they are “internal” or “external,” thereby rendering that distinction

   agency?  I  want  to  consider  two  perspectives  we  might  take  in  thinking
   about responsibility, what we might call an inner and an outer perspective.
   The <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">inner perspective </span>is that of the agent herself, involving her having and
   exercising (or failing to exercise) certain agential capacities and so choosing
   and controlling her actions. The <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">outer perspective </span>is that from which we assess
   someone’s conduct and—crucially—her will as a matter of holding her to
   account. In each case, responsibility is always to a certain set of norms. From
   the internal perspective, these are norms that are <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">binding </span>on her (or to which
   she binds herself); from the outer perspective these are norms in terms of
   which  we  assess  her  and  so  to  which  we  <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">hold  </span>her.  My  aim  in  this  paper
   is to argue that the inner perspective does not have priority over the outer
   perspective and thus that the theoretical approach is mistaken: our ability,
   prominent from the inner perspective, to take responsibility and so to hold
   ourselves accountable is not intelligible apart from our having a place in a
   broader community in which others hold us accountable. This idea, of course,
   is familiar to readers of Strawson’s “Freedom and Resentment”. However,
   unlike Strawson, I do not think this implies that the outer perspective is prior
   to the inner, for ultimately I think we cannot make sense of an agent’s being
   properly held accountable unless he can take responsibility for his actions
   in  a  way  that  ultimately  presupposes  his  freedom.  This  is  not  something
   I  can  argue  here;  rather,  my  claim  will  be  that  we  cannot  understand  an
   agent’s being accountable as depending simply on the agent herself; rather,
   accountable agency depends on capacities that are essentially social.</span></details>

   philosophical theory as recently as 15 years ago and still highly influential
   in psychology today, understand emotions to be essentially clusters of beliefs
   and desires. Thus, cognitivists claim, what it is to be afraid of something is
   to believe it dangerous and want to get away. The intentionality of emotions
   is therefore understood to be dependent on that of the constitutive beliefs
   and desires, and it seems that there is nothing we could call a distinctively
   “affective” intentionality. Indeed, for cognitivists affect is seemingly added
   on as an afterthought: the relevant belief and desire somehow come packaged
   together  with  a  bodily  sensation  (of  a  sinking  feeling  in  your  gut,  for
   example), and it is this packaging of those intentional states with a feeling
   that  was  supposed  to  account  for  their  affective  nature.  As  I  shall  argue,
   such cognitivist accounts of emotions fail to capture the distinctively affective
   character  of  emotions.  A  central  reason  for  this  failure  lies  in  the  kind
                                                                          
                                                                          
   of evaluations that emotions essentially involve. Cognitivist theories must
   understand  emotional  evaluations  to  be  a  part  of  either  the  belief  or  the
   desire;  in  either  case,  they  are  supposed  to  be  intelligible  prior  to  the
   emotions  themselves.  My  contention  is  that  this  is  false:  we  cannot  make
   sense  of  these  evaluations  except  in  terms  of  the  emotions  themselves,
   and  it  is  this  fact  about  emotions  that  enables  us  to  understand  affective
   intentionality.  That  is,  I  shall  argue,  what  is  characteristic  of  affective
   intentionality is that it essentially involves evaluations that are felt, where
   such feelings are simultaneously both responsive to and constitutive of that
   evaluation. Our felt awareness of emotional objects as good or bad in some
   way just is a matter of our being emotionally pleased or pained by these
   objects, and this fact about emotions is central to understanding the nature
   of affective intentionality.</span></details>

   irrationality, and nowhere does this irrationality show up more clearly than
   in  their  effects  on  motivation.  Thus,  to  take  some  stereotyped  examples,
   fear, anger, and jealousy frequently seem to move us to act contrary to our
   better judgment. Recently, however, there has been increasing emphasis on
   the rationality of emotions and their place in practical reason. Thus, while
   deliberating about what to do, although we may be able to articulate reasons
   for and against each option, we may not be able to say why the weight of
   these reasons favor one over the others; in such cases, we may simply go with
   the one that “feels” right—that resonates more fully with our emotional sense
   of our circumstances—and such an appeal to emotions seems appropriate. I
   argue that emotions are fundamental to motivation and practical reasoning.
   In particular, emotions motivate not because they involve mere dispositions
   to behave but rather because they are rational responses to things we care
   about, responses that sometimes rationally demand intentional action. This,
   together with the way our linguistic concepts can inform these emotional
   responses,  makes  for  rational  interconnections  with  evaluative  judgments
   that allow our emotions to play a significant role in our determining what to
   do.</span></details>

   their distinctively evaluative intentionality. Emotions are essentially affective
   modes  of  response  to  the  ways  our  circumstances  come  to  matter  to  us,
   and so they are ways of being pleased or pained by those circumstances.
   Making sense of the intentionality and phenomenology of emotions in this
   way  requires  rejecting  traditional  understandings  of  intentionality  and  so
   coming to see emotions as a distinctive and irreducible class of mental states
   lying at the intersection of intentionality, phenomenology, and motivation.</span></details>

   Authenticity,  it  is  plausible  to  suppose,  is  a  feature  of  one’s  identity  as  a
   person—of  one’s  sense  of  the  kind  of  life  worth  living.  Most  attempts  to
   explicate this notion of a person’s identity do so in terms of an antecedent
   understanding of what it is for a person to value something. This is, I argue,
   a  mistake:  a  concern  is  not  intelligible  as  a  value  apart  from  the  place  it
   has within a larger identity that the value serves in turn to constitute; to
   assume otherwise is to risk leaving out the very person whose identity these
   values allegedly constitute. By contrast, I offer an account of values as always
   already a part of one’s identity. I do so by providing an analysis of values
   in terms of what I call ’person-focused emotions,’ emotions like pride and
   shame.  Such  emotions,  I  argue,  involve  a  commitment  to  the  import  of  a
   person primarily and, only secondarily, to things valued, and in this way
   enable us to understand what it is to value these things for the sake of the
   person. The upshot is a more satisfying account of a person’s identity and
   values, an account that can provide the necessary background for a more
   thorough investigation of authenticity.</span></details>

   Genuine   agents   are   able   to   engage   in   activity   because   they   find   it
   worth   pursuing—because   they   care   about   it.   In   this   respect,   they
   differ  from  what  might  be  called  “mere  intentional  systems”:  systems
   like  chess-playing  computers  that  exhibit  merely  goal-directed  behavior
   mediated by instrumental rationality, without caring. A parallel distinction
   can  be  made  in  the  domain  of  social  activity:  plural  agents  must  be
   distinguished  from  plural  intentional  systems  in  that  plural  agents  have
   cares and engage in activity because of those cares. In this paper, I sketch
   an account of what it is for an individual to care about things in terms of
   her exhibiting a certain pattern of emotions. After extending this account to
   make sense of an individual’s caring about other agents, I then show how a
   certain sort of emotional connectedness among a group of people can make
                                                                          
                                                                          
   intelligible the group’s having cares and thereby constitute that group as a
   plural agent. Alternative accounts of social action, by ignoring the difference
   between mere intentional systems and genuine agents, and so by leaving out
   these emotional entanglements from their accounts of social action, thereby
   fail to capture a whole range of social phenomena involving plural agents.</span></details>

   argues  that  pleasure  and  pains  are  not  qualia  and  they  are  not  to  be
   analyzed in terms of supposedly antecedently intelligible mental states like
   bodily  sensation  or  desire.  Rather,  pleasure  and  pain  are  characteristic  of
   a  distinctive  kind  of  evaluation  that  is  common  to  emotions,  desires,  and
   (some)  bodily  sensations.  These  are  felt  evaluations:  passive  responses  to
   attend  to  and  be  motivated  by  the  import  of  something  impressing  itself
   on  us,  responses  that  are  nonetheless  simultaneously  constitutive  of  that
   import by virtue of the broader rational patterns of which they are a part
   and that they serve to de?ne. This account of felt evaluations makes sense
   of the way in which pleasures and pains grab our attention and motivate us
   to act and of the peculiar dual objectivity and subjectivity of their implicit
   evaluations, while o?ering a phenomenology adequate to both emotional and
   bodily pleasures and pains.</span></details>

   is  the  problem  of  understanding  how  we  can  have  rational  control  over
   what  we  do.  In  the  face  of  phenomena  like  weakness  of  the  will,  it  is
   commonly  thought  that  evaluation  and  reason  can  always  remain  intact
   even  as  we  sever  their  connection  with  motivation;  consequently,  solving
   the motivational problem is thought to be a matter of figuring out how to
   bridge this inevitable gap between evaluation and motivation. I argue that
   this is fundamentally mistaken and results in a conception of practical reason

   and the rational interconnections among emotions, desires, and evaluative
   judgments,  I  articulate  a  new  conception  of  evaluation  and  motivation

   about personal, non-moral values involves elements of both invention and

   account  of  causation  have  received  so  little  attention  in  the  secondary
   literature  on  the  subject.  The  first  is  the  distinction  of  causation  into  the
   natural and the philosophical relations: Although many have tried to give
   accounts of why Hume presents two definitions of causality, it is often not
   clear  in  these  accounts  that  the  one  definition  is  of  causality  as  a  natural
   relation  and  the  other  is  of  causality  as  a  philosophical  relation,  where
   to  make  the  contrast  between  these  two  kinds  of  relations  we  need  to
   give a naturalistic account of natural relations and a normative account of
   philosophical relations. (That Hume intends this to be the contrast will be
   defended in more detail below.) The second element is that, in many cases of
   our inferences from cause to effect, “we must follow our taste and sentiment”
   (A Treatise of Human Nature [T], 103), where the appeal to taste here, as
   in morality and aesthetics, is not to be understood as up to the individual.
   Rather,  Hume  makes  it  clear  both  in  Book  3  of  the  Treatise  and  in  “Of
   the  Standard  of  Taste”  that  there  are  standards  to  which  our  individual
   judgments (in morality, aesthetics, or causality) must conform. My purpose
   in this paper is to attempt to provide an interpretation of Hume’s account of
   causality that brings these two elements explicitly into the foreground. This
   interpretation is, to a greater extent than usual, a reconstruction of Hume’s
   account of our causal inferences, drawing, as I have indicated above, from a
   range of texts not normally associated with Hume’s discussion of causality.
   As such, this interpretation should be considered as exploratory in nature,
   perhaps focussing too single-mindedly on these two elements in an attempt
   to make out as strong a case as possible for their relevance in understanding
   Hume’s account of causal inference.</span></details></li></ol>

<!--l. 313--><p class="indent" >   Race and gender are centrally important to each of our lives. But what are
they exactly? How many races or genders are there? Who has what race or
what gender? How are these answers determined? (Are race and gender
biologically real? Are they socially constructed? Would their being socially
constructed make them any less real?) How does someone’s race or gender
affect their social position? What injustices do these social positions involve,
and what can or should we do about them? How are these social positions
affected by intersecting social identity categories, including not only race
and gender but also class, sexuality, ability, religion, and more? Drawing
on fields such as philosophy, sociology, women’s and gender studies, and
critical race theory, we will critically examine a variety of answers to these
questions, in the process trying to understand how we can have reasonable and
productive disagreements about these contentious and politically charged
issues.

<!--l. 317--><p class="indent" >   This course provides an introduction to some central problems, concepts, and
methods of cognitive science and moral psychology. We will address questions
concerning the nature of intelligence, the relationship between minds and
bodies, and the basis of moral beliefs and behaviors. These explorations will
bridge the sciences and humanities by taking a fundamentally interdisciplinary
perspective.

<!--l. 321--><p class="indent" >   This class is designed as a general introduction to the philosophy of mind (and,
consequently, as an introduction to the philosophical side of both majors in the
Scientific and Philosophical Studies of Mind program: Cognitive Science and Moral
Psychology). We will begin by examining the mind–body problem, a problem which
arises out of our differing conceptions of the natural world and of our minds. In
particular, science tells us that the body is just a hunk of physical matter that obeys the
laws of nature mechanistically—mindlessly. The mind, of course, is anything but
mindless. So what’s the connection between the two? How should we conceive of the
mind in relation to the body? In trying to answer this question, we will critically
examine several different purported solutions to this problem and assess how
they fare with respect to understanding particular issues that arise in the
context of this mind–body problem: the nature of representation, consciousness,
psychological explanation, freedom, and meaning, and identity. In addressing these
questions, we shall gain a clearer understanding of the strengths, weaknesses, and
implications of the various theories about what the mind is and its relation to the
body.

<!--l. 325--><p class="indent" >   It has long been perceived by many philosophers that there is a problem about the
relationship between the mind and the body. The body, after all, is just a hunk of
physical matter that obeys the laws of nature mechanistically—mindlessly—whereas
the mind, of course, is anything but mindless. So what’s the connection between the
two? How do we conceive of the mind in relation to the body? In this course
we’ll examine mostly contemporary accounts of the relation in an attempt to
understand whether there really is a mind–body problem and, if so, how to
solve it. But this course is about more than just the mind and its place in the
broader world; it’s about the nature of that world, too. In the course of trying to
understand how our thoughts can be <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">about </span>anything in the world, we’ll need to
think about the nature of the world such that our thoughts can be about
it.

<!--l. 329--><p class="indent" >   Long neglected in philosophy, the emotions have recently and increasingly come to
be seen as important both in their own right and for their bearing on a wide variety of
issues, including (a) the mind–body problem and the nature of consciousness and
intentionality, (b) the nature of rationality, (c) aesthetics, (d) interpersonal
relationships, and (e) moral psychology and metaethics. My intention in this course is
to focus on the first two such issues, since the other issues are covered more
fully in other courses. However, in doing so it is important that we have a
sufficiently rich understanding of the place emotions can have in our lives, an
understanding that many philosophers and psychologists tend to simplify and
diminish.

<!--l. 333--><p class="indent" >   Philosophers tend to understand the concept of a person in two ways: as a
metaphysical notion and as a moral notion. <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">Moral personhood </span>is roughly an
understanding of ourselves as the subjects of moral rights and responsibilities. By
contrast, to understand personhood as a <span 
class="pplri9d-x-x-109">metaphysical </span>notion is to understand it as
delineating a special category of being—as having or being a soul, for example.
Typically, the metaphysical notion of personhood is thought to somehow
underwrite our status as moral persons. Indeed, it is precisely because of this
explanatory link between them that many philosophers think it is appropriate to
understand the concept of personhood not as having two senses but rather
as being a univocal concept with two aspects. Our aim in this course is to
examine these notions and their interrelations, with an emphasis on our social
nature.

<!--l. 337--><p class="indent" >   Moral psychology is the study of us persons as responsible moral agents and
subjects of value. As such, it is constrained by, and must cohere with, the
facts about human psychology; but its primary focus is on human good, an
evaluative notion. Topics include virtue and character, motivation and reasons,
internal/external reasons and moral development, and responsibility and
blame.

<!--l. 341--><p class="indent" >   Love and friendship are undoubtedly important in our lives … but why? Although
we commonly say that we “love” both chocolate cake and philosophy or that we are
“friends” with people on Facebook, these seem to be thin surrogates for the
potentially deep, rich, intimate, and rewarding attitudes and relationships we develop
towards and with other persons. Clearly it is the latter that we interested in here:
forms of love and friendship that apply paradigmatically to intimate relations among
persons. In investigating personal love and friendship, we will encounter several
problems concerning their justification, their bearing on the autonomy and identity of
the individual, and the place their value has within a broader system of values,
including moral values.

<!--l. 345--><p class="indent" >   Recently many philosophers have argued that certain interpersonal emotions, such
as resentment, indignation, guilt, gratitude, and approbation, are fundamental to a
host of interconnected issues in ethics, including the nature of respect, dignity,
                                                                          
                                                                          
responsibility and freedom, and the origins of moral values. This class will closely
examine these claims and arguments with the aim of understanding more clearly how
moral psychology and metaethics intersect.
